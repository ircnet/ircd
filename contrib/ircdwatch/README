DESCRIPTION
===========
  ircdwatch is a daemon that regularly checks to see if ircd is running.
  if ircd should die or somehow stop running, ircdwatch will respawn the
  ircd daemon.  if desirable, ircdwatch can be configured to check if
  the ircd configuration file is changed and send a SIGHUP to the ircd
  daemon which then causes the daemon to reload the configuration
  file.

  the ircdwatch program itself is also used as sort of a remote
  control depending on what command line arguments you feed it. you
  can use it to start ircd and stop ircd and ircdwatch.

OPTIONS
=======
  if you invoke ircdwatch without any command line arguments it will
  either daemonize itself and become a daemon, or it will exit if it
  detects that an ircdwatch daemon is already running.

  for using the ircdwatch program as a remote control the following
  command line options are available:

  --kill
     stop both ircdwatch and ircd

  --rest
     stop ircdwatch but leave ircd running

  --help
     list command line arguments


COMPILE TIME CONFIGURATION
==========================
  you configure ircdwatch by editing config.h in the directory where
  you build ircd.  the configuration parameters available for
  ircdwatch are those starting with the prefix "IRCDWATCH_".  please
  refer to the config.h file for more information on the parameter
  settings. most of the defaults should be okay if you want to  use
  ircdwatch though.
