This file describes how to prepare a package for inclusion
in the contrib/ directory.  The goal is to have a consistent
setup for all contributions, making it easy to install any
of them.

* each package must have a README file (at least) explaining
  what it is about.
* a man page would be nice ;-)

* packages are stored in contrib/<package name>

* C programs:
	* If possible, use the same coding style as in the
	  rest of the package.
	* They need to be portable
	* They should use "setup.h" or "os.h"
	* If needed, they may have a *.h file generated by configure
	* They are to be compiled from within the same
	  directory as irc/ircd, using the same Makefile


* questions, submissions should be sent to ircd-dev@irc.org
