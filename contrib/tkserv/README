Welcome to TkServ !
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

I) Introduction
---------------

TkServ is a so-called temporary k-line service. 

[If you don't know what a service is, consult the documentation which comes 
along with the irc2.10.x package (if you don't know services, you shouldn't 
be reading this anyway ;).]

This is what TkServ does - roughly: On request, it adds a given k-line
pattern to the server's k-line list and (sooner or later, see below) then
removes it. The adding/removing is done via the ircd.conf file.

The purpose/advantages of a temporary k-line service:

  - it facilitates the process of k-lining users
  - added k-lines disappear automatically (see below)
  - it allows _also_ remote users (only if they are listed in the access
    file of the service - see below) to temp k-line users on the respective
    server
  - it allows people to specify a duration for each tkline
  - it is more effective than /kill but practically as easy to use
  - it could therefore act as a replacement for the /kill command - which in
    fact is more or less its longtime goal...


II) Security concerns
---------------------

Of course, when allowing remote "access" to the ircd.conf file, the main
concern of most admins is security. Therefore, here's a list of the 
procedures used by TkServ to ensure that only authorized users may add
temporary k-lines to the server's conf file [origin == the person who is
sending a request]:

- the origin's user@host has to match one of the u@h's in the tkserv.access
  file (case sensitive!)
- the origin has always to specify a password which has to match the
  password that belongs to the corresponding user@host in the access file
  (case sensitive!)
- the origin has to be opered, if you want to
- it is possible to allow an authorized user to only tkline given hostnames
  or TLDs

Especially the third point equals to strong security, because: Could you
imagine any cracker who has gained O: on some server, wasting his time on
trying to get access to a remote server's temp k-line list instead of
playing around with his O: ? See, neither could i. ;-)


III) Installation
-----------------

A) Precondition
   
   The only thing you need in order to run TkServ is an "ircd.conf" file,
   an "ircd.pid" file and an IRC server which has been compiled with
   USE_SERVICES #define'd in the config.h file (!).

B) Editing the configuration file (config.h)

   You have to change the following entries in the config file:

   TKSERV_ADMIN_NAME (your real name)
   TKSERV_ADMIN_CONTACT (mail address)
   TKSERV_ADMIN_OTHER (your nick, for example)

   TKSERV_NAME (the name of the service appearing on /SERVLIST)
   TKSERV_DESC (a neato description :)
   TKSERV_DIST (the distribution of the service)

|  A few words to the distribution of the service. Here are the pros &
|  contras of a global TkServ from my point of view:
|
|  [contra] It makes the /servlist become unnecessarily big and less handy
|  [contra] You can detect also local services by /trace'ing a server
|  [contra] You can access a local TkServ by setting up a special client
|           on the concerned server (maybe with a special I: line)
|
|  [pro]    A global TkServ is more comfortable to use for remote users.
|  [pro]    If you want to see which server is running one (for e.g. to
|           request access to it), you do only have to do a /servlist.

   TKSERV_PATH (the abs. path to your ircd.conf, no trailing slash please!)
   TKSERV_LOGFILE (the abs. path to your tkserv logfile, no trailing slash)
   TKSERV_ACCESSFILE (the abs. path to your tkserv access file, ditto)
   
   TKSERV_DEBUGGING (for debugging only, displayes traffic to standard output)
   
C) Compiling the source

TkServ will be compiled along with the irc server.

D) Setting up the access file: tkserv.access

   If anyone should be authorized to use TkServ on your server, he/she has
   to figure in the access file. The format of it is:

|   [!]<user@host.domain.tld><SPACE><password><SPACE>[<FQDN || IP>]<RETURN>
|
|   Which means:
|   [!]<user@host.domain.tld> <password> [<FQDN || IP>]
|
|   A '!' before the u@h means that the specified user doesn't need to be
|   opered when accessing TkServ. Before the FQDN/IP, it means that the user
|   is not allowed to tkline that given FQDN/IP. See below.
|
|   Examples:
|   (1) foo@bar.com foo-pass
|   (2) some@user.on.the.net some.passw1 *.net,207.128.*
|       another@user.foo.com Akfdsv.df *netcom.com,*.ca
|       you@get.the.picture.org ditto. *.org,dialup*.lamer.net,194.44.44.*
|       oper@dialup*.dialup.net pwd1.2 *dialup.net,145.44.*,*.fr
|   (3) !luser@doesnt.need.to.be.opered.org bleh !elite.org,*.org
|   (4) !~luser@no.ident.no.oper.com yo *.com
|
|   (1) Any oper who is running identd and whose userhost equals to
|       foo@bar.com can tkline everyone if supplied password equals
|       foo-pass.
|   (2) Any oper with identd whose u@h equals to some@user.on.the.net
|       can tkline everyone whose TLD is ".net" or who is IRCing within
|       the IP subnet 207.128.*, if correct password is given.
|   (3) Any luser (no need to be opered) whose u@h/passwd equals can tkline
|       everyone whose TLD is ".org" except the host "elite.org"
|       ("*@elite.org").
|
|   Generally, you should be aware of the fact that if you put something
|   in the FQDN/IP field, then you automatically restrict the access.
|   Therefore, you must then also indicate all the allowed FQDNs/IPs.
|
|   The access routines are pretty flexible. So pay attention in what order
|   you allow/disallow what. :)
|
|   Other examples:
|   !foo@bar.com foo-pass !*.net,*.com,!*.com
|   some@user.on.the.net some.passw1 *.net,207.128.*,!127.0.0.*
|   another@user.foo.com Akfdsv.df *netcom.com,!*trends.ca,*.ca
|
|   Notice that if you allow "*.de" and after it you forbid "blah.de",
|   this won't work. The oper will still be able to tkline blah.de since
|   "*.de" appears before "!blah.de" in the access field.
|
|   Are we confused, yet? ;-)

   For some other examples, refer to the tkserv.access.example file, which
   is included in the package.

   The u@h field for the user can also contain wildcards, as you can see.

|   If you specify an FQDN (or several of them in a comma-separated 
|   list), the concerned user will only be allowed to tkline users from 
|   that FQDN(s). Everything is done via 'wildcard-matching' (if any).
|   I.e. that "home.blah.de" matches only "*@home.blah.de". If you want
|   to allow a whole TLD, you have to do this by putting "*.tld" in the
|   access field.

! An empty FQDN/IP field means that the concerned user can tkline everyone. !
  [Except *@* that is.]

E) Setting up the S: line in your ircd.conf file

   If you're not yet familiar with S: lines, consult the documentation of
   the ircd package.

   S:<host>:<password>:<name>:33554432:<class>

   <host> is the FQDN from which the service will connect to the server.

   The service type 33554432 is mandatory! Currently, TkServ will refuse 
   any other service type. [Actually, it won't, but it's good to think that
   it will... ;-]

   The service class should refer to an existing class (according to the
   documentation :).

F) Starting TkServ

   The command line syntax of TkServ looks like this:
   
   tkserv <server> <port> <password>
   or
   tkserv <Unix domain socket> <password>

   Example:

   tkserv localhost 6667 my-serv.pass

   Where <server> is the address of your IRC server, <port> the port to
   which TkServ will connect and <password> the password for the service.

G) Adding temp k-klines (TKLINE)

   Provided that TkServ recognizes you, you can add temporary k-lines via
   the TKLINE command, which has three different variants:

   (1) :TKLINE <password> <lifetime in hours> <user@host> <reason>
   (2) :TKLINE <password> <user@host> <reason>
   (3) :TKLINE <password> -1 <user@host>

   (1) adds a tkline for <u@h> with an expire time of <lifetime> hours and
       with the reason <reason>.
   (2) adds a tkline for <u@h> with the default expire time (2 hours) and
       with the reason <reason>.
   (3) removes any existing tklines found for <user@host>.   

   Examples:

   (1) :TKLINE my.pass 5 lamer@lamers.org dont flood
   (2) :TKLINE blah. *@foo.com stop spamming
   (3) :TKLINE my.pass -1 lamer@lamers.org

   <lifetime> must be > 0 and < 168.

|   [If your client doesn't support SQUERY, the entire cmd line has to be:
|   "/quote squery <name of tkserv> :tkline ...". If it does support it,
|   then "/squery <name of tkserv> tkline ..." should do it.]
|
|   [And yes, ircII-EPIC4 supports SQUERY and SERVLIST! ;-)]
|
|   If a non-opered user tries to use TKLINE without having a matching entry
|   in the access file, he gets "Only IRC-Operators may use this command" as
|   an error message. This is not correct anymore, but i didn't bother to
|   change it (since it may prevent kids from playing around with TkServ :).

H) Online help/info

TkServ does also have a little online help which is accessible via
"/squery <service name> help".

I) Quitting the service

To make TkServ quit IRC you have to send him the following SQUERY:

QUIT <password>

Where <password> corresponds to password that you indicated at startup. 
Be aware that anyone who knows that password can make your TkServ quit.

J) Debugging

If you #define DEBUGGING in the config.h file, everything which is sent
to the server from the service and from the server to the service will be
displayed to the standard output.


IV) Misc, or what goes where

TkServ will create the following permanent files in your ircd directory: 

ircd.conf.tkserv (backup of the ircd.conf file)
tkserv.log (TkServ's log file)

The latter will contain most of the error messages (in case something goes 
wrong - what we all don't hope ;) as well as logs of successful TKLINE 
requests.

The tkserv.access file has to be in the directory specified in the config.h
file. If no tkserv.access file is found, no one will be able to add temp 
k-lines.

Now and then you should zero your TkServ logfile because this won't happen
by itself. =)

See the CREDITS file.


VI) Bugs, comments, suggestions...

Send everything to kl@berlin.Snafu.DE or to Kasi@IRC. :-)


VII) The TkServ-mailinglist

There's now a mailinglist for TkServ out there. It is used for general
announcements (bugs, new releases, etc.) concerning TkServ. Since it's a
read-only mailinglist, it doesn't have much traffic. You can subscribe to
it by sending a mail to tkserv@kl.Snafu.DE with "subscribe" in the subject
or in the body of the mail.


Enjoy, -Kasi
