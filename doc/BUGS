The list is probably not as scary as it once was.
Anyone with some free time is welcome to fix those =)

* The server still occasionnally crashes because of some bug
  in the hash tables. (Vesa already fixed this bug several
  times but it keeps crashing :^)

* inetd support isn't functional.

* RECONNECT is still in some unknown state. (and deactivated
  for various reasons)

* NOTE is part of the server code.

* Rehashing after removing P: line(s) occasionally makes the server crash.
