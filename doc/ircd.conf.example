#
# This is an example configuration file for the IRC server.
# It's highly suggested that you also read INSTALL.* in doc/ and talk with
# your uplinks if linking to an already existent IRC network.
# 
# You only need an ircd.conf (IRC server configuration file) if you are
# running an IRC server. iauth.conf (IRC authentication daemon configuration
# file) may also be needed.
#
# This file will explain the various lines in the IRC server
# configuration file. Not all lines are mandatory. You can check to make
# sure that your configuration file is correct by using the program
# "chkconf", provided in the server distribution (and when you do "make
# install" this program will be installed in the same directory as the irc
# server). 
# 
# The options for whether a line is needed or not are: 
# MANDATORY: you absolutely MUST have this line
# NETWORKED: you must have this line if you are connecting this irc
#            server to any other server (servers can run standalone).
# SUGGESTED: it is HIGHLY suggested that you use this line
# OPTIONAL: it's completely up to you whether to define this or not
# DISCOURAGED: you really really should not use this line if at all
#              possible. 
# NOT NECESSARY: an old or out of date line that isn't needed.
#
#
# ========================================================================
# NOTE! this entire configuration file is read UPSIDE-DOWN! So if you have
# to put something in a specific order (for example, client-connection
# lines), put them in reverse order!
# ========================================================================
#

############################
# M: [MANDATORY]. This line sets your server's name, description and port
# the server listens for UDP pings (used to determine the fastest link in a
# class when autoconnecting)
#
# M:<Server NAME>:<YOUR Internet IP#>:<Geographic Location>:<Port>:<SID>:
#
# Note that 'server name' refers to the name of the irc-server which needs 
# not to be the same as the hostname of the machine it's running on.
# Note that <SID> must be globally unique, so if you are part of bigger
# network, ask other admins, what to set it to. If you are on IRCnet, ask
# your local coord. If you are (BIC) Coord on IRCnet, you have a pool of
# 36 SIDs to choose from. Check doc/ISO-3166-1 file to find your country
# numeric code (example: 000) and assign one SID for every of your servers
# starting from 000A, through 000Z, 0000 and ending at 0009.
#
# This let's ircd use the primary ip of your host to establish connections
M:example.irc.org::Example Geographic Location, Planet Earth:6667:000A
#
# This let's ircd use the ip 127.0.0.2 to establish connections, useful
# if you're running virtual interfaces
#M:example.irc.org:127.0.0.2:Example Geographic Location, Planet Earth:6667:000A:

############################
# A: [MANDATORY]. This line lists your administrative information
# (contact address, etc). To view this information, /admin (server) will
# show it to you.

# A:<Your Name/Location>:<Your E-Mail Addr>:<other info>::<network name>:
# Note that <network name> *must* be one word.
#
A:Organization, IRC dept.:Daemon <ircd@example.irc.org>:Client Server::IRCnet:
#
#
############################
# P: [MANDATORY]. This field allows the server to listen on various ports
# for connections. Any internet domain port that is below 1024 means the
# ircd has to be run as root, or from inetd. The server can listen to ports
# in the UNIX domain or the internet domain. If you wish to create a port
# in the UNIX domain you must compile with UNIXPORT defined in config.h.
#
# P:<YOUR Internet IP#>:<*>::<Port>:<Flags>
# P:<Directory>:<*>:<*>:<Port>:<Flags>
#
# Note that it's a good idea to open some more ports than 6667 for 
# server-server connections and local clients in case some running wild 
# client blocks the default 6667.
#
# The default, an internet domain socket on port 6667 listening on all
# ip addresses of the machine running ircd 
P::::6667::
#
# an internet domain socket listening on port 6668 on address 206.252.192.20
# (again useful if you're running virtual interfaces)

############################
# Y: [SUGGESTED]. These lines define connection classes. Connection
# classes allow you to fine-tune your client and server connections.
# Since the fields have different meanings for server and client classes
# you shouldn't mix them, and if you have lots of server connections (if 
# you do have lots of servers you shouldn't be reading this file :-) each 
# set of servers (defined arbitrarily by you) should have its own class. 
# If you have clients coming in from lots of different sites, you may want 
# to seperate them out into classes. For instance, you may want to put 
# local users in one class, with remote users in another class. You may also
# want to put limits on some client classes (one client only for indials
# for example).  In any larger network you definitely want to do this.
#
# For SERVER CLASSES, the fields are: 
# Y:<Class>:<Ping Frequency>:<Connect freq>:<Max Links>:<SendQ>::
#    1       2                3              4           5      67
#   1 class number
#   2 ping frequency (in seconds)
#   3 connect frequency (in seconds)
#   4 maximum number of automatically initiated links in this class
#   5 sendq
#   6 unused for server classes
#   7 unused for server classes
#
# Sendq have the format <x>.<y>, where x defines sendq whereas y defines
# burst sendq. It is useful to have for example 1MB normal sendq and 20MB
# of burst sendq, which allows for quicker broken link detection.
#
# The class numbers are not arbitrary.  In auto-connecting servers -- that is,
# servers that you have a port number (e.g. 6667) on the end of the C: line 
# (see below) the higher the number the higher the priority in auto-connecting.
#
# Note that it is a good idea to have ping frequency the same at both ends
# of the link.
#
# This is a normal (uncompressed) server connection (normal as of January, 2005)
# Y:<Class>:<Ping Frequencys>:<Connect freq>:<Max Links>:<SendQ>::
Y:2:90:300:1:20000000::
#
#
# For CLIENT CLASSES, the fields are:
# Y:<Class>:<Ping Frequency>::<Max Links>:<SendQ>:<Local Limit>:<Global Limit>:
#    1       2               3 4           5       6             7
#   1 class number
#   2 ping frequency (in seconds)
#   3 unused for client classes
#   4 maximum number of links in this class (per I line)
#   5 sendQ for each client
#   6 maximum number of links from this [user@]host on the server
#   7 maximum number of links from this [user@]host on the net
#
# Local and global limits have the format <x>.<y> where x defines the maximum
# number of clients from the same host (IP) whereas y defines the maximum 
# number of clients from the same user@host (IP) allowed to connect.  the
# latter uses the identd replies to identify a user, falling back to an
# @host limit if no identd runs on the client and fails for identds generating 
# dynamical answers.
#
# Note that any unset values default to zero which means 'unlimited', except
# for limits, where default is 1.1
# 
# Y:<Class>:<Ping Frequency>::<Max Links>:<SendQ>:<Local Limit>:<Global Limit>:
# this is a class for multiuser systems allowing 10 local clients per host
Y:10:90::100:512000:10.2:32.2:
#
# This is a class for multiuser systems running a trustworthy identd
Y:11:90::100:512000:0.1:0.2:
#
# This is a class for single user systems (PCs, most indials, ...)
Y:12:90::100:512000:1.1:2.1:
#
# This is a class for remote systems you want to allow as fallback only
# (if you run an open server in a net you might really want this)
Y:13:90::100:512000:1.1:1.1:
#
#
############################
# I: [MANDATORY]. The I: lines are client-authorization lines. Without
# these lines, no clients will be able to connect to your server.
# Wildcards ("*") are permitted. Passwords are also possible (clients can
# be configured to send passwords) but optional. 'I' allows full access,
# 'i' sets restricted mode which forbids nick changes and channel op status.
# Note that 'i' is deprecated and you should use <Flags> (see INSTALL).
#
# <TARGET Host Addr> accepts CIDR format.
# 
# I:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Hosts NAME>:<Port>:<Class>:<Flags>:
#
# NOTE that ircd matches on both fields and if <TARGET Hosts NAME>
# is not empty (even if "*"), the client is required to have DNS.
#
# This would allow access for any client reaching this line which doesn't
# already have at least one connection to the net.  if you run an open server
# in a net this might be the right choice, talk to your uplinks first anyway.
# Note listing this i: line first, it will be checked *last*, meaning it is 
# the "fall-through". 
#i:*@*::::13::
# With the password 'foobar'
#i:*@*:foobar:::13::
#
# this would allow access for any client coming from *.net, *.org, *.com or
# other 3 char TLD
#i:::*@*.???:13::
#
# This allows access for any client from the ip block 192.168.0.0/16
# regardless of its domain. If it's resolvable it will be shown as
# user@host since the field <TARGET Hosts NAME> is empty (useful to
# allow whole provider's blocks).
I:*@192.168.0.0/16::::12::
#
# This is a standard vanilla I: line which will permit anyone with an IP
# address within ip block 127.0.0.0/8 AND with a hostname ending in
# .irc.org to connect to the server. 
I:*@127.0.0.0/8::*@*.irc.org::10::
#
# and you can even specify just certain usernames as long as the client's 
# site is running a trustworthy ident daemon:
I:::gooduser@example.irc.org::10::
# 
# this will limit access for indials to one client per host (as defined in Y:12)
I:::*@ppp*.irc.org::12::
I:::*@indial*.irc.org::12::
#
#
############################
# O: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define operator access. You do not need to
# have an operator to run a server. A well configured leaf site should not
# need an operator online, if its connections are well defined, the irc
# administrator can use 'kill -HUP' on the ircd to reload the configuration
# file. 
#
# O:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Password>:<Nickname>:<Port>:<Class>:<Flags>:
#
# If the person in "Nickname" is not coming from the hostname defined in
# the first field then the person will get the error message "No O: lines
# for your host". 
#
# Note that you don't need to use 'Nickname' to become operator, if you're
# using some other nick at that moment '/oper Nickname' will do also.
#
O:*.bu.edu:Zaphod:Trillian::10:
#
# and this line forces ident match:
O:hrose@csa.bu.edu:Zaphod:Trillian::10::
# 
# and this line allows oper to come from ip block:
O:192.168.0.0/16:Zaphod:Trillian::10::
#
# a crypted password line (NOTE that if you have crypted passwords, *all*
# of you passwords must be crypted! In fact, if you are getting an error
# "Incorrect Password" it may well be because crypted passwords are
# defined and you have used plaintext.  So my example of plaintext and
# crypted strings in the same IRC server configuration file is an
# impossibility (but it is just theoretical, which is why I explained both).
#
O:rocker@csa.bu.edu:T0eiVgHrqeKTQ:Rocker::10::
#
# New for 2.11 are flags for O:line. They specify permissions for various
# activities (kill, connect, squit etc.) of an operator.
# The easiest is flag 'A' -- most possible permissions; read INSTALL file
# for details.
#
# Warning: if you add no flags, no privileges will be granted. 
#
O:192.168.0.0/16:icmptz:Beeth::10:A:
#
# This line is a "local operator", it is specified with an O:line flag 'L'.
#
# this line permits the nickname "jhs" with the password of "ITBites" to
# be a local operator only (restrictions are defined in config.h during
# ircd compilation time).
#
O:*.bu.edu:ITBites:jhs::10:L:
#
# Lower case o:line (which is deprecated and will be removed in next version)
# and O:line with 'L' flag have exactly the same meaning.
#
############################
# c/C: [NETWORKED]. These lines define what servers your server tries to
# connect to.  'c' means your server will support compression for this link
# if you've compiled with zlib, 'C' will enforce an uncompressed link.
# N: [NETWORKED]. These lines define what servers your server permits
# to connect.
#
# c/N lines MUST be used in pairs. You cannot have one without the other. 
#
# C:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Server NAME>:<TARGET PORT>:<Class>:<Source IP>:
# c:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Server NAME>:<TARGET PORT>:<Class>:<Source IP>:
#
# if the target server listens on different ports you can use for <TARGET PORT>
# <port_to_connect_to>.<port_target_server_listens_for_udp_pings>.
# <TARGET Host Addr> can be also an ip address or CNAME.
# With <Source IP> you can specify source ip ircd will try to connect with
# to a given server.
#
# N:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Server NAME>:<Domain Mask>:<Class>:
#
# "domain mask" is the number of parts in *your* hostname to mask to. For
# instance, with servername being "example.irc.org", if you wanted to present
# servername to be "*.irc.org" you would have a host-mask portion of "1". 
#
# it is *strongly* advised that your c/N line passwords be different for
# security's sake.
#
# ident is allowed in the server's hostname part of the field.
# these lines tell the server to automatically (note the port number, that
# means automatic connection) connect to cs-ftp.bu.edu:
C:hrose@cs-ftp.bu.edu:bigspark:cs-ftp.bu.edu:6667:2::
N:hrose@cs-ftp.bu.edu:bigalpha:cs-ftp.bu.edu::2::

N:irc-2.mit.edu:andsoarellamas:irc-2.mit.edu:1:2::
#
# If you have defined ZIP_LINKS and wish the connection to irc-2.mit.edu to
# be compressed, you need to use a lowercase c.  If the other server refuses
# or doesn't support compression it will fall back to an uncompressed link.

############################
# K: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define user@host patterns to be banned from
# this particular server (with an optional time field). Note that K: lines
# are *not* global, and if you ban a user they can still use any other IRC
# server (unless they have specifically been banned there as well).
# 'K' uses the the type unix reply from the client's identd if available or
# the USER information supplied by the client if not.  'k' uses the reply from
# the client's identd also if it's type other (it's prefixed with '-' then).
# 
# K:<Host Name or IP>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<User>:<port>:
# k:<Host Name or IP>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<Auth>:<port>:
#
# wildcards are permitted in any one of the fields, in other words, you can
# K:*::*:: if you wanted (but your server wouldn't be used much ;-)
#
# Note that if you specify an IP address, or IP mask, it will match clients
# connecting from the matching addresses, no matter if they resolve or not.
# You can prefix an IP address or IP mask by '=' in which case only non 
# resolving matching hosts will be banned.
#
# This k: line bans the username "FSSPR" (the wildcard is used to make
# sure that any ident-checking character will match) on any machine from
# the University of Alaska.
k:*.alaska.edu::*FSSPR:0:
#
# This K: line bans any users from acs*.bu.edu between the hours of 8am
# and 12pm and 1pm and 5pm (the time is always the server's local time):
# Note that 24 hour time is used (no "AM" or "PM").
# (for this to work, you have to define TIMEDKLINES in config.h)
K:acs*.bu.edu:0800-1200,1300-1700:*:0:
#
# This K: line bans any users from *foo.edu sending them the notice
# "Use server irc.bar" instead of the default notice
# "You are not welcome to this server"
K:*foo.edu:Use server irc.bar:*:0:
#
# This K: line bans any users from *toto.fr from using the port 6667,
# and tells them to use port 6666 instead.
K:*toto.fr:Use port 6666:*:6667:
#
# This K: line bans any user from 129.69.0.0/16 as long the host doesn't run
# identd (no matter if it replies type unix or other) from all ports.
k:129.69.0.0/16:identd (rfc1413) required:unknown::

# This does the same but only for unresolvable clients
k:=129.69.0.0/16:identd (rfc1413) required:unknown::
#
#
############################
# L: [OPTIONAL]. These lines "Leaf" specified servers. They are only
# useful if you are a non-leaf site yourself. There are two ways you can
# use L: lines. The first will limit one particular site to a particular
# tree depth (including 0, which would mean the server has to connect with
# no servers linked behind it otherwise the connection will fail). The
# second will allow you to be selective about which other servers you wish
# the connecting server to behave as a leaf towards.
#
# The fields are as follows:
# L:disallow connections to this hostmask::server name:depth
# For example, this will force kaja.gi.alaska.edu to connect only as a
# leaf (if it is not a leaf, the link will be dropped):
L:::kaja.gi.alaska.edu::
# This line will force cm5.eng.umd.edu to have a depth of only 1 below it
# (that is, it is allowed to have only leaves connected to it):
L:::cm5.eng.umd.edu:1:
#
# This line will prohibit anything matching *.edu to be connected behind
# any server matching *.au:
L:*.edu::*.au::
#
#
############################
# H: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define who you permit to act as a "hub" to
# you (that is, who you permit to connect non-leafed servers to you).
#
# the first field may use wildcards, the third field *must* be an exact
# match for a server's name (NOT a server's hostname, if they differ, the
# server's name must be used). If the servername is a wildcard (e.g. *.au)
# that is an acceptable name for the third field. 
#
# Empty 2nd field is equal to '*', that is all SIDs are allowed to be
# introduced via this link.
#
# The fields are as follows:
# H:servers which are permitted entry:sid mask:hub server::
#
# Example, permit cs-ftp.bu.edu to allow any servers behind it to connect:
H:*::cs-ftp.bu.edu::
#
# Example, permit irc-2.mit.edu to allow any MIT servers behind it to
# connect: 
H:*.mit.edu::irc-2.mit.edu::
#
# Example, permit irc-2.mit.edu to allow any MIT servers behind it to
# connect, but only if they have SID begining with "000":
H:*.mit.edu:000*:irc-2.mit.edu::
# Note that requiring SID makes it impossible for 2.10 server to connect.
#
############################
# D: [OPTIONAL]. Control how auto connections are done. This will be mostly 
#                useful for networks with complex configurations.
#
# D:<Denied Server Mask>:<Denied Class>:<Server Mask>:<Server Class>:
#   1                    2              3             4
#
# If a server matching <Denied Server Mask> or a server in <Denied Class>
# is present (or absent, if <Denied Server Mask> is prefixed with '!')
# ircd won't auto connect to any server matching <Server Mask>
# or being in <Server Class> although auto connect for those is active.
#
# Example, don't auto connect to *.fi if some server of *.edu is already
# linked
D:*.edu::*.fi::
#
# Example, don't auto connect to *.fi if no server of *.edu is yet linked
D:!*.edu::*.fi::
#
# Example, don't auto connect to *.fi or any server in class '3'  if a
# server from our class '2' is already present
D::2:*.fi:3:
#
#
############################
# V: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define restrictions on servers connecting to
# you.
#
# The first and third fields accept wildcards.  The fields are as follow:
# V:<Version Mask>:<Flags>:<Server Mask>::
#
# Example, 2.10 is an old version, and you want your peers to upgrade:
V:IRC/0210*::*::
#
# If you are running a production network, you most likely don't want to
# allow servers compiled in DEBUGMODE which is a threat for the net
# as well as for the privacy of the users:
V:*:D:*::
#
# Finally, you don't want *.edu servers to be version 2.10.2 *OR* to be
# compiled with remote oper kills enabled:
V:IRC/021002*:K:*.edu::
#
#
############################
# B: [SUGGESTED]. These lines define the alternate servers that the users
# will be redirected to if your server is full.
#
# The fiels are as follow:
# B:<Class|Host Mask>::<Server Name>:<Port>:
#
# For example, if you want to redirect your users to irc.stealth.net on port
# 6667 when your server is full, use:
B:-1::irc.stealth.net:6667:
#
# To redirect *.fi users when your server cannot accept any new user with
# a hostname matching *.fi, use:
B:*.fi::irc.funet.fi:6667:
#
#
############################
# S: [OPTIONAL]. These lines define services allowed to connect to your
# server.  Each service needs a separate line which only allows him to
# connect once. Remember to compile the ircd with #define USE_SERVICES
# in config.h, otherwise you can't use services.
#
# The fields are as follow:
# S:<TARGET Host Mask>:<Password>:<Service Name>:<Service Type>:<Class>
#
# Example, you want to allow a local information service:
S:eep.local.net:thisisapassword:EepInfo:0:1
#
# Another example, with hex mask. This is a temporary kline service (tkserv) 
# as you can find it in contrib/tkserv :
S:eep.local.net:thisisapassword:TkEep:0x2000000:1
#
#
############################
# Q: [DISCOURAGED]. These lines "quarantine" specified servers.  Because
# of the way they operates, the same Q: lines MUST be installed by
# everyone or the net will keep breaking. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.
# Do NOT use Q: lines lightly!
#
# The fields are as follows:
# Q:*:reason why quarantine is in place:servername
#
Q::this server is too slow and lags the net:cm5.eng.umd.edu::
