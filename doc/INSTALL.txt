  This document describes how to install, and configure IRC 2.9.4.

  11..  IInnssttaalllliinngg IIRRCC..

  This package uses a GNU configure script for its configuration.  You
  simply need to untar the distribution and run the ``configure''
  script.  This will run configure which will probe your system for any
  peculiarities it has and setup the Makefile and a file of default
  #define's ($arch/setup.h).

  There are a few options to ``configure'' to help it out, or change the
  default behaviour:

     ----pprreeffiixx==DDIIRR
        changes the default directory into which ircd will install using
        ``make install''.  This defaults to /usr/local

     ----lliibbddiirr==DDIIRR
        changes the default directory where most irc files will go.
        (default is prefix/lib/ircd)

     ----rreessccoonnff==FFIILLEE
        defines the file to be used by ircd to initialize its resolver.
        (default is /etc/resolv.conf)

     ----zzlliibb--iinncclluuddee==DDIIRR
        specifies in which directory the include file from the zlib is
        located.

     ----zzlliibb--lliibbrraarryy==DDIIRR
        specifies in which directory the zlib library is located.

     ----zzlliibb--pprreeffiixx==DDIIRR
        specifies the prefix for zlib location.  It overrides the 2
        previous options.  (The include directory is supposed to be in
        prefix/include, and the library in prefix/lib).

     ----wwiitthh--zzlliibb
        is the default.  ``configure'' looks on your system to find the
        zlib.  If found, ircd will be linked using it.  This does NOT
        mean you can use server link compression, for this you also need
        to define ZIP_LINKS (see section below).

     ----wwiitthhoouutt--zzlliibb
        tells ``configure'' not to look for the zlib.  Defining this
        will keep you from using server link compression.


  22..  TThhee ccoonnffiigg..hh ffiillee

  The second step consists of defining options before the compilation.
  This is done by editing the ``config.h'' file and changing the various
  #DEFINE's.


  22..11..  DDeeffiinnee wwhhaatt ttyyppee ooff UUNNIIXX yyoouurr mmaacchhiinnee uusseess..

  Pick the machine type which best describes your machine and change the
  #undef to #define (if needed).Some flavours of Unix require no #define
  and in such cases all others should be #undef'd.


  22..22..  DDEEBBUUGGMMOODDEE

  Define DEBUGMODE if you want to see the ircd debugging information as
  the daemon is running. Normally this function will be undefined as
  ircd produces a considerable amount of output.  DEBUGMODE must be
  defined for either of -t or -x command line options to work.  Defining
  this induces a large overhead for the server as it does a large amount
  of self diagnostics whilst running.

  Define SPATH to be the directory path to ircd.  This is usually
  /usr/local/sbin/ircd, unless you don't have installation permission
  there.

  Define CPATH to be the directory path to the ``ircd.conf'' file. This
  path is usually /usr/local/lib/ircd/ircd.conf. The format of this file
  will be discussed later.

  The LPATH #define should be set to ``/dev/null'' unless you plan to
  debug the program.  Note that the logfile grows very quickly.

  Define MPATH to be the path to the ``motd'' (message of the day) file
  for the server.  Keep in mind this is automatically displayed whenever
  anyone signs on to your server.

  The PPATH is optional, but if defined, should point to a file which
  either doesn't exist (but is creatable) or a previously used PPATH
  file.  It is used for storing the server's PID so a ps(1) isn't
  necessary.

  Define TPATH to be the directory path to the ``ircd.tune'' file. This
  path is usually /usr/local/lib/ircd/ircd.tune.  This file is used by
  the server to optimize memory use.


  22..44..  CCAACCHHEEDD__MMOOTTDD

  The server sends the ``motd'' to every client connecting.  Every time,
  it reads it from the disk.  This is quite intensive and can be
  undesirable for busy servers.

  Defining CACHED_MOTD will make the server store the ``motd'' in
  memory, and only read it again from the disk when rehashing if the
  file has changed.


  22..55..  CCHHRROOOOTTDDIIRR

  To use the CHROOTDIR feature, make sure it is #define'd and that the
  server is being run as root.  The server will chroot to the directory
  name provded by ``IRCDDIR'' (in Makefile).


  22..66..  EENNAABBLLEE__SSUUMMMMOONN,, EENNAABBLLEE__UUSSEERRSS

  For security conscious server admins, they may wish to leave
  ENABLE_USERS undefined, disabling the USERS command which can be used
  to glean information the same as finger can.  ENABLE_SUMMON toggles
  whether the server will attempt to summon local users to irc by
  writing a message similar to that from talk(1) to a user's tty.

  22..77..  SSHHOOWW__IINNVVIISSIIBBLLEE__LLUUSSEERRSS,, NNOO__DDEEFFAAUULLTT__IINNVVIISSIIBBLLEE

  On large IRC networks, the number of invisible users is likely to be
  large and reporting that number cause no pain.  To aid and effect
  this, SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS is provided to cause the LUSERS command to
  report the number of invisible users to all people and not just
  operators.  The NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE define is used to toggle whether
  clients are automatically made invisible when they register.


  22..88..  OOPPEERR__KKIILLLL,, OOPPEERR__RREEHHAASSHH,, OOPPEERR__RREESSTTAARRTT,, LLOOCCAALL__KKIILLLL__OONNLLYY

  The three operator only commands, KILL, REHASH and RESTART, may all be
  disabled to ensure that an operator who does not have the correct
  privilidges does not have the power to cause untoward things to occur.
  To further curb the actions of guest operators, LOCAL_KILL_ONLY can be
  defined to only allow locally connected clients to be KILLed.


  22..99..  ZZIIPP__LLIINNKKSS,, ZZIIPP__LLEEVVEELL

  As of the 2.9.3 version of the server, server-server connections may
  be compressed using the zlib.  In order to compile the server with
  this feature, you MUST have the zlib package (version 1.0 or higher)
  already compiled and define ZIP_LINKS in the config.h file.
  Compression use for server-server connections is separately configured
  in the ircd.conf file for each server-server link.  ZIP_LEVEL allows
  you to control the compression level that will be used.  Values above
  5 will noticeably increase the CPU used by the server.

  The zlib package may be found at  <http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/zlib/>.
  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request
  for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
  <ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt> (zlib format), rfc1951.txt
  (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are
  also available in other formats from
  <ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html>


  22..1100..  SSLLOOWW__AACCCCEEPPTT

  This option is defined by default and is needed on some OSes.  It
  creates an artificial delay in processing incoming connections.  On a
  given port, no more than 1 connection per 2 seconds will be processed.

  Undefining this will let the server process connections as fast as it
  can which can cause problems on some OSes (such as SunOS) and be
  abused (fast massive join of clonebots..), for these reasons, if you
  decide to undefine SLOW_ACCEPT you MUST define CLONE_CHECK.


  22..1111..  CCLLOONNEE__CCHHEECCKK

  This option acts as a wrapper, by checking incoming connections early
  before starting ident query.  By default, the server will not accept
  more than 2 connections from the same host within 10 seconds.


  22..1122..  OOtthheerr ##ddeeffiinnee''ss

  The rest of the user changable #define's should be pretty much self
  explanatory in the config.h file.  It is *NOT* recommended that any of
  the file undef the line with "STOP STOP" in it be changed.



  33..  EEddiittiinngg tthhee MMaakkeeffiillee,, aanndd ccoommppiilliinngg

  This package now uses GNU autoconf to probe your system and generate
  the correct Makefile.  However you need to edit it to specify specific
  information, such as ``prefix'', ``irc_mode'', ``ircd_mode'' and
  ``ircd_dir''.

  Now to build the package, type ``make''.  If everything goes will, you
  can then install it by typing ``make install''.

  If you have trouble compiling ircd, copy Makefile.in to Makefile and
  edit Makefile as appropriate.

  After installing the ircd and irc programs, edit the ircd.conf file as
  per the instructions in this section and install it in the location
  you specified in the config.h file.  There is a sample conf file
  called example.conf in the doc/ directory.

  Appendix A (See INSTALL.appendix) describes the differences between IP
  addresses and host names.  If you are unfamiliar with this, you should
  probably scan through it before proceeding.

  The ircd.conf file contains various records that specify configuration
  options.  The record types are as follows:

  1. Machine information     (M)

  2. Administrative info     (A)

  3. Port connections        (P)

  4. Connection Classes      (Y)

  5. Client connections      (I,i)

  6. Operator privileges     (O)

  7. Restrict lines          (R)

  8. Excluded accounts       (K,k)

  9. Server connections      (C,c,N)

  10.
     Hub connections         (H)

  11.
     Leaf connections        (L)

  12.
     Version limitations     (V)

  13.
     Excluded machines       (Q)

  14.
     Service connections     (S)

        IRC needs to know a few things about your UNIX site, and the
        ``M'' command specifies this information for IRC.  The fomat of
        this command is:

     FFoorrmmaatt

        M:<Server NAME>:<YOUR Internet IP#>:<Geographic Location>:<Port>



     MM  ``M'' specifies a Machine description line

     SSeerrvveerr NNAAMMEE
        The name of YOUR server adding any Internet DOMAINNAME that
        might also be present. If this hostname can be resolved, the IP#
        found will be used to for outgoing connections.  Otherwise the
        default interface address of the host is used.  The server name
        may not be FQDN of another host.  (This means all outgoing
        connections will be done from the same IP#, even if your host
        has several IP#).

     YYOOUURR IInntteerrnneett IIPP##
        If the machine on which you run the server has several IP
        addresses, you can define which IP# to use for outgoing
        connections.  This overrides overrides the ``Server NAME''.

        See Also the ``Port Connections'' section.

     GGeeooggrraapphhiicc LLooccaattiioonn
        Geographic Location is used to say WHERE YOUR SERVER is, and
        gives people in other parts of the world a good idea of where
        you are!  If your server is in the USA, it is usually best to
        say: <CITY> <STATE>, USA.  Like for Denver I say: ``Denver
        Colorado, USA''.  Finnish sites (like tolsun.oulu.fi generally
        say something like ``Oulu, Finland''.

     PPoorrtt
        Defines the port on which your server will listen for UDP pings
        from other servers.  This should be the port were other servers
        are set to autoconnect.  (Also see the port field description in
        connect lines).

     EExxaammppllee::
        M:tolsun.oulu.fi::Oulu, Finland:6667:

        This line reads: My Host's name is ``tolsun.oulu.fi'' and my
        site is located in ``Oulu, Finland''.

        M:orion.cair.du.edu::Denver Colorado, USA:6667:

        This line reads: My Hosts name is ``orion.cair.du.edu'' and my

        The ``A'' line is used for administrative information about a
        site. The e-mail address of the person running the server should
        be included here in case problems arise.
     FFoorrmmaatt

        A:<Your Name/Location>:<Your Electronic Mailing Addr>:<other>::



     AA  This specifies an Admin record.

     YYoouurr NNaammee && LLooccaattiioonn
        Use this field to say tell your FULL NAME and where in the world
        your machine is.  Be sure to add your City, State/Province and
        Country.

     YYoouurr EElleeccttrroonniixx MMaaiilliinngg AAddddrr
        Use this field to specify your Electronic Mailing Address
        preferably your Internet Mailing Address.  If you have a UUCP or
        ARAPnet address - please add that as well.  Be sure to add any
        extra DOMAIN information that is needed, for example ``mail
        jtrim@orion'' probably won't work as a mail address to me if you
        happen to be in Alaska.  But ``mail jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu''
        would work because you know that ``orion'' is part of the DOMAIN
        ``cair.du.edu''.  So be sure to add your DOMAINNAMES to your
        mailing addresses.

     OOtthheerr
        This is really an OTHER field - you can add what you want here.

     EExxaammppllee
        (the line is just one line in the confuration file, here it is
        cut into two lines to make it clearer to read):

        UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim:Terve! Heippa!  Have you said hello
        in Finnish today?;)::

        Would look like this when printed out with the /admin command:

        UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim Terve! Hei! Heippa!  Have you said
        hello in Finnish today? ;)


        Note that the A record cannot be split across multiple lines; it
        will typically be longer than 80 characters and will therefore
        wrap around the screen.

     IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn
        The port line adds flexibility to the server's ability to accept
        connections. By use of this line in the ircd.conf file, it is
        easy to setup both Unix Domain ports for the server to accept
        connections on as well as extra internet ports.

     FFoorrmmaatt

        P:<Internet IP#>:<*>:<Internet IP Mask>:<Port>:
        P:<Directory>:<*>:<*>:<Port>:




  +o  Internet Ports

     IInntteerrnneett IIPP##
        If the host on which the server runs has several IP addresses,
        you can define for which IP address connections will be
        accepted. If no is defined here, server will bind to all
        interfaces (INADDR_ANY).  See also MACHINE CONFIGURATION section
        to properly configure outgoing connections.

        P:192.168.1.194:::6664:

     IInntteerrnneett IIPP## MMaasskk
        This defines where connections may come from and be accepted.
        The IP mask uses either *'s or 0's as wildcards. The following
        two lines are the same:


        P:::128.2.*:6664:
        P:::128.2.0.0:6664:



     The incoming isn't matched against the mask, rather the ip# string
     is decoded and compared segment by segment. Thus

     P:::128.2*.1.2:6664:

     will not match 128.20.1.2.

     PPoorrtt
        The port number field tells the server which port number it
        should listen on for incoming connections.

  +o  Unix Socket Ports.

     DDiirreeccttoorryy
        The path set in this field should be the directory name in which
        to create the unix socket for later listening to. The server
        will attempt to create the directory before creating the unix
        socket.

     PPoorrtt
        The port field when used in combination with a pathname in a P-
        line is the filename created in the directory set in the first
        field.

     EExxaammppllee
        P:/tmp/.ircd:::6667:

        Creates a unix socket in the /tmp/.ircd directory called
        ``6667''. The unix socket (file) must be a numerical.


     NNoottee
        You need at least one P line.


  44..44..  CCoonnnneeccttiioonn CCllaasssseess


     IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn
        To enable more efficient use of MAXIMUM_LINKS, connection
        classes were implemented.  All clients belong to a connection
        class.

        Each line for a server should have the same number as the sixth
        field.  If it is absent, the server deaults it to 0, using the
        defaults from the config.h file.
        To define a connection class, you need to include a Y: line in
        the ircd.conf file.  This enables you to define the ping
        frequency, connection frequency (for servers) and maximum number
        of links that class should have.

        Currently, the Y: line MMUUSSTT appear in the ircd.conf file BBEEFFOORREE
        it is used in any other way.

     FFoorrmmaatt

        Y:<Class>:<Ping Frequency>:<Connect freq>:<Max Links>:<SendQ>:<Local Limit>:<Global Limit>



     YY  This specifies a Class record.

     CCllaassss
        This is the class number which gains the following attributes
        and should match that which is on the end of the C/c/N/I/O/S
        line.

     PPiinngg FFrreeqquueennccyy
        This field defines how long the server will let the connection
        remain ``silent'' before sending a PING message to make sure it
        is still alive.  Unless you are sure of what you are doing, use
        the default value which is in your config.h file.

     CCoonnnneecctt FFrreeqquueennccyy
        By changing this number, you change how often your server checks
        to see if it can connect to this server. If you want to check
        very occasionally, use a large value, but if it is an important
        connection, you might want a smaller value so that you connect
        to it as soon as possible.

     MMaaxx LLiinnkkss
        This field defines the maximum number of links this class will
        allow from automatic connections (C lines).  Using /CONNECT
        overrides this feature.  Also defines the maximum number of
        users in this class (I/O lines).

     SSeennddQQ
        This field defines the ``SendQ'' value for this class.  If this
        field is not present, the default (from config.h) is assigned.

     LLooccaall lliimmiitt
        This field is used to limit the number of local concurrent
        connections.  The format is <x>.<y>

     +o  x: defines the maximum number of clients from the same host (IP)
        will be allowed.

     +o  y: defines the maximum number of clients from the same user@host
        (IP) will be allowed.  Read note below.

        This field has the same use as the ``Local limit'' field.  But,
        the connection counts are done for all clients present on the
        net instead of only counting local clients.

     NNoottee
        leaving any of the fields (except SendQ) out means their value
        is 0 (ZERO)!!  The SendQ field default value is dynamically
        determined.

     NNoottee
        If you plan to use the local user@host limit, please read the
        following very carefully.  The ``user'' value is the ident reply
        for the connection.  If no reply was given then it defaults to
        ``unknown'' and thus the effective limit will be per host, not
        per user@host. Also, some ident servers return encrypted data
        which changes for every connection making the limit void.

     NNoottee
        Only the local limitation is accurate.

     NNoottee
        If you define a gobal limit, you should also define a local
        limit (same or lower) as it won't take more CPU and will make
        the global limit more accurate.

     NNoottee
        The local and global limits only affect users (I lines), not
        servers nor services.

        Y:23:120:300:5:100000:0:0: (server class)

        This defines class 23 to allow 5 auto-connections, which are
        checked every 300 seconds.  The connection is allowed to remain
        silent for 120 seconds before a PING is sent.  NOTE: fields 3 &
        4 are in seconds.  The SendQ is set to 100000 bytes.

        Another feature of connection class is the ability to do
        automatic routing by using the class as a ``priority''.  If you
        are connected to a server which has a class lower than one of
        the servers that is ``behind'' it, the server will disconnect
        the lower class one and schedule a ``new'' connection for the
        higher class server.

        Y:1:60:0:50:20000:2:5: (client class)

        In case of a client class, the fields are interpreted a bit

        users.  The connections are allowed to remain silent for 60
        seconds before a PING is set.  The SendQ is set to 20000 bytes.
        A new connection in this class will only be allowed if there
        aren't more than 2 other local connections from the same IP
        address, or more than 5 other connections on the net from the
        same hostname.

  How to let clients connect to your IRCD.

     IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn
        A client is a program that connects to the ircd daemon (ircd).
        There are clients written in C, GNU Emacs Lisp and many other
        languages.  The ``irc'' program is the C client.  Each person
        that talks via IRC is running their own client.

        The ircd.conf files contains entries that specify which clients
        are allowed to connect to your irc daemon.  Obviously you want
        to allow your own machine's clients to connect.  You may want to
        allow clients from other sites to connect.  These remote clients
        will use your server as a connection point.  All messages sent
        by these clients will pass through your machine.

     FFoorrmmaatt

        I:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Hosts NAME>:<Port>:<Class>
        i:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Hosts NAME>:<Port>:<Class>



     TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt AAddddrr
        Specifies the IP address(es) of the machine(s) that are allowed
        to connect.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual IP address the
        server will require that the remote username returned by the
        ident server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.
        Wildcards are permitted.

     PPaasssswwoorrdd
        The password that must be given by the client to be allowed on
        the server.

     TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt NNAAMMEE
        Specifies the host name(s) of the machines allowed to connect to
        the server.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual IP address the
        server will require that the remote username returned by the
        ident server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.
        Wildcards are permitted.

        This field can be empty, it then has a special meaning.  See
        Below.

     PPoorrtt
        Specifies the port number for which this configuration line is
        valid.  An empty field, or ``0'' matches all ports.

     CCllaassss
        This field should refer to an existing class.  Connections
        classes are usefull to limit the number of users allowed on the
        server.

     NNoottee
        The server first checks if the client hostname (or any aliases)
        matches the TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt NNAAMMEE field.  If a match is found, the
        client is accepted.  If not, the server checks if the IP address
        of the client matches the TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt AAddddrr field.  The matching
        field is used to set the name of the client: for example, if the
        client matches the TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt AAddddrr field, it will show on IRC
        with a numerical address (even if this address is resolvable).
        If the TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt NNAAMMEE field is empty, then the host name is
        always used (when available).

     EExxaammpplleess
        For example, if you were installing IRC on tolsun.oulu.fi and
        you wanted to allow examples sake let us assume you were making
        this file for tolsun and you wanted to let your own clients to
        connect to your server, you would add this entry to the file:

        I:x::tolsun.oulu.fi::1

        If you wanted to let remote clients connect, you could add the
        following lines:

        I:x::*.du.edu::1

        Allow any clients from machines whose names end in ``.du.edu''
        to connect with no password.

        I:128.214.6.100::nic.funet.fi::1

        Allow clients from a machine with that IP number to connect.
        Numeric match is enough, name is not required anymore.

        I:x:secret:*.tut.fi::1

        Allow clients from machines matching ``*.tut.fi'' to connect
        with the password ``secret''.

        I:*::*::1

        Allow anyone from anywhere to connect your server.

        This is the easiest way, but it also allows people to for
        example dump files to your server, or connect 1000 (or how many
        open sockets per process your OS allows) clients to your machine
        and take your network ports. Of course the same things can be
        done by simply telnetting to your machine's SMTP port (for
        example).

        I:x::*.fi:6667:1

        Allow clients from machines matching ``*.fi'' to connect on the
        port 6667.

        I:135.11.35.*::*.net::1

        Allows clients from machines which host name matches ``*.net''
        or which IP address matches ``135.11.35.*'' to connect to the
        server.  If the host name does not match ``*.net'' then the IP
        address is used for these clients, even if the host name is
        known.

        I:135.11.35.*::::1

        Allows clients from machines which IP address matches
        ``135.11.35.*'' to connect to the server.  If the host name is
        known, is it used as address for these clients.

     NNEEWW!!!!!!
        As of the 2.7.2d version of the server, the server is able to
        accept connections on multiple ports. I-lines are required for
        each P-line to allow connections to be accepted. For unix
        sockets, this means either adding I:/path/port::/path/port or
        some variation (wildcards are recognised here). For internet
        ports, there must be an I-line which allows the host access as
        normal, but the port field of the I-line must match that of the
        port of the socket accepting the connectiion. A port number of 0
        is a wildcard (matches all ports).

     NNEEWW!!!!!!
        As of the 2.9.1 version of the server, i lines are introduced.
        They work the same way as I lines, but the clients matching an i
        line will have a restricted connection. (no nick/mode change, no
        kick). Such users will have their username prefixed by +, = or -
        depending on the ident reply.

  How to become the IRC administrator on your site

     IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn
        To become an IRC Administrator, IRC must know who is authorized
        to become an operator and what their ``Nickname'' and
        ``Password'' is.

     FFoorrmmaatt

        O:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Password>:<Nickname>:<Port>:<Class>



     OO  Speficies Operator record. If you use capital letter (``O'') in
        it, it specifies a global operator. Small letter (``o'')
        specifies a local operator. Local operator has basically the
        same rights except global operator with some restrictions.

     TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt NNAAMMEE
        Tells IRC which host you have the privileges FROM.  This means
        that you should be logged into this host when you ask for the
        priviliges.  If you specify ``tolsun.oulu.fi'' then IRC will
        expect your CLIENT to be connected at ``tolsun.oulu.fi'' - when
        you ask for OPERATOR privileges from ``tolsun.oulu.fi''.  You
        cannot be logged in at any other host and be able to use your
        OPERATOR privileges at tolsun, only when you are connected at
        TOLSUN will this work - this is a safeguard against unauthorized
        sites.

     PPaasssswwoorrdd
        If your AUTHORIZATION Password - this is the password that let's
        IRC know you are who you say you are!  Never tell anyone your
        password and always keep the ``ircd.conf'' file protected from
        all of the other users.

     NNiicckknnaammee
        The Nickname you usually go by - but you can make this what you
        want.

     PPoorrtt
        Unused.

     CCllaassss
        The class field should refer to an existing class (preferably
        having a lower number than that for the relevant I-line) and
        determines the maximum number of simultaneous uses of the O-line
        allowable through the max. links field in the Y-line.

     EExxaammppllee
        O:orion.cair.du.edu:pyunxc:Jeff::1

        There is an OPERATOR at ``orion.cair.du.edu'' that can get
        Operator priviliges if he specifies a password of ``pyunxc'' and
        uses a NICKNAME of ``Jeff''.

  Let an external program decide if a client should be allowed or not.

     IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn
        R lines provide a convenient way to handle user access to the
        server with an external program.  The outside program given
        three parameters: the client's username (set by the USER
        command), the client's hostname, and the client's ident reply
        (``unknown'' if none).

        It is expected to return a reply line where the first word is
        either ``Y'' or ``N'' meaning `Yes Let them in'' or ``No don't
        let them in''.  If the first word begins with neither ``Y'' or
        ``N'' the default is to let the person on.

     FFoorrmmaatt

     RR  This specifies a restrict record.

     TTaarrggeett HHoosstt NNaammee
        In this field you specify the Hostname that the user is
        connecting from.  If you wanted to restrict connects to IRC from
        ``orion.cair.du.edu'' then you would want to enter
        ``orion.cair.du.edu''.

     PPrrooggrraamm

  Remove an errant user from IRC on your site.

     IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn
        Obviously it is hoped that you wouldn't have to use this
        command.  Unfortunately sometimes a user can become unmanageable
        and this is your only recourse - the KILL USER command.  THIS
        COMMAND ONLY AFFECTS YOUR SERVER - If this user can connect to
        another SERVER somewhere else in the IRC-Network then you would
        have to talk to the administrator on that site to disable his
        access from that IRCD Server as well.

     FFoorrmmaatt

        K:<Host Name>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<User>:<port>:



     FFoorrmmaatt

        k:<Host Name>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<Auth>:<port>:



     KK  ``K'' tells the IRCD that you are making a KILL USER command
        entry.

     HHoosstt NNaammee
        In this field you specify the Hostname that the user is
        connecting from.  If you wanted to REMOVE connects to IRC from
        ``orion.cair.du.edu'' then you would want to enter
        ``orion.cair.du.edu''.  If you want to REMOVE ALL HOSTS access
        you can use ``*'' (Wild Card notation) and no matter what host
        the USERNAME (specified in Field 4) connects from s/he will be
        denied access. Removing all hosts isn't very smart thing to do
        though, why would you run an ircd if you allow nobody to connect
        to it anyways ?

        If you specify an IP address, or IP mask, it will match clients
        connecting from the matching addresses, no matter if they
        resolve or not.

        You can prefix an IP address or IP mask by ``='' in which case
        only non resolving matching hosts will be banned.

        Either leave this field empty or put a comment, then the line
        active continuously for the specified user/host machine.  You
        may also specify intervals during the line should be active, see
        examples below.

     UUsseerr
        The USERNAME of the user you want removed from IRC.  For example
        ``root''.

     AAuutthh
        If the user's ident server replies with the OTHER type (as
        opposed to the UNIX type), the reply is not used to set the
        user's username.  (lowercase) k lines can be used in these case
        to reject users based on their ident reply.

        This field will be matched against the ident server reply.  It
        is important to note that OTHER replies are prefixed with a
        ``-'' by the ircd, while UNIX replies are not.

     PPoorrtt
        The port on which the Kill line will be effective. 0 means all
        ports.

     EExxaammpplleess
        K:orion.cair.du.edu::jtrim:0:


        If user ``jtrim'' connects to IRC from host

        k:*.stealth.net::-43589:0:

        If a user connects from any host that has the suffix
        ``stealth.net'' and if that host ident server returns ``-43589''
        - then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THEM from my IRCD.

        K:*.cair.du.edu::root:0:

        If user ``root'' connects to IRC from any host that has the
        suffix ``cair.du.edu'' - then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THEM from my

        K:*::vijay:0:

        This line reads ``I don't care WHAT HOST user ``vijay'' is on, I
        will NEVER allow username ``vijay'' to login to my IRCD.''

        K:*.oulu.fi:0800-1200,1400-1900:*:0:

        This disallows all users from hosts with enddomain ``oulu.fi''
        access to your server between 8 and 12am, 2 and 7pm. Users get
        kicked off if they're already signed on when the line becomes
        active (they'll get a warning 5 minutes ago).

        K:192.11.35.*::*:0:

        This line disallows all hosts whose IP address matches

  How to connect to other servers, How other servers can connect to you

  WWAARRNNIINNGG:: The hostnames used as examples are really only examples and
  not meant to be used (simply because they don't work) in real life.


  Now you must decide WHICH hosts you want to connect to and WHAT ORDER
  you want to connect to them in.  For my example let us assume I am on
  the machine "rieska.oulu.fi" and I want to connect to irc daemons on 3
  other machines:

  +o  ``garfield.mit.edu''        - Tertiary Connection

  +o  ``irc.nada.kth.se''         - Secondary Connection

  +o  ``nic.funet.fi''            - Primary Connection


  And I prefer to connect to them in that order, meaning I first want to
  try connecting to ``nic.funet.fi'', then to ``irc.nada.kth.edu'', and
  finally to ``garfield.mit.edu''.  So if ``nic.funet.fi'' is down or
  unreachable, the program will try to connect to ``irc.nada.kth.se''.
  If irc.nada.kth.se is down it will try to connect to garfield and so
  forth.

  PLEASE limit the number of hosts you will attempt to connect to down
  to 3. This is because of two main reasons:

  1. to save your server from causing extra load and delays to users

  2. to save internet from extra network traffic (remember the old rwho
     program with traffic problems when the number of machines
     increased).


     FFoorrmmaatt

        C:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<TARGET PORT>:<Class>



     for example:

     C:nic.funet.fi:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     - or -

     C:128.214.6.100:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     - or -

     C:root@nic.funet.fi:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     Each field is separated with a ":" charcter:

     CC  This field tells the IRC program which option is being

     TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt AAddddrr
        Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
        to.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the

        ident server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.

     PPaasssswwoorrdd

     TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt NNAAMMEE
        The full hostname of the target machine. This is the name that
        the TARGET server will identify itself with when you connect to
        it.  If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi you would receive
        ``nic.funet.fi'' and that is what you should place in this
        field.

     TTAARRGGEETT PPOORRTT
        The INTERNET Port that you want to connect to on the TARGET
        machine. Most of the time this will be set to ``6667''.  If this
        field is left blank, then no connections will be attempted to
        the TARGET host, and your host will accept connections FROM the
        TARGET host instead.  The port field can contain 2 ports,
        separated by a . In this case, the first port is used when auto-

     NNEEWW!!!!!!
        As of the 2.9.3 version of the server, server connections can be
        compressed with the zlib library.  To define a compressed
        connection, you must have compiled the server with ZIP_LINKS
        defined (cf 2.h), and use a _lowercase_ C line.

  Some examples:

  +o  C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     This reads: Connect to host ``nic.funet.fi'', with no password and
     expect this server to identify itself to you as ``nic.funet.fi''.
     Your machine will connect to this host to port 6667.

  +o  C:18.72.0.252:Jeff:garfield.mit.edu:6667:1

     This reads: Connect to a host at address ``18.72.0.252'', using a
     password of ``Jeff''.  The TARGET server should identify itself as
     ``garfield.mit.edu''.  You will connect to Internet Port 6667 on
     this host.

  +o  C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:1

     This reads: do not attempt to connect to ``irc.nada.kth.se'', if
     ``irc.nada.kth.se'' requests a connection, allow it to connect.

  Now back to our original problem, we wanted OUR server CONNECT to 3
  hosts,  ``nic.funet.fi'', ``irc.nada.kth.se'' and ``garfield.mit.edu''
  in that order.  So as we enter these entries into the file they must
  be done in rreevveerrssee order of how we could want to connect to them.

  Here's how it would look if we connected ``nic.funet.fi'' first:

  C:garfield.mit.edu::garfield.mit.edu:6667:1
  C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:6667:1
  C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1

  Ircd will attempt to connect to nic.funet.fi first, then to irc.nada
  and finally to garfield.

  RReecciipprrooccaall eennttrriieess:: Each ``C'' entry requires a corresponding ``N''
  entry that specifies connection priviliges to other hosts.  The ``N''
  entry contains the password, if any, that you require other hosts to
  have before they can connect to you.  These entries are of the same
  format as the ``C'' entries.



     FFoorrmmaatt
        The format for the NOCONNECT entry in the ``ircd.conf'' is:

        N:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Domain Mask>:<Class>



     Let us assume that ``garfield.mit.edu'' connects to your server and
     you want to place password authorization authorization on garfield.
     The ``N'' entry would be:

     N:garfield.mit.edu:golden:garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a connection from host ``garfield.mit.edu'',
     and expect a login password of ``golden'', and expect the host to
     identify itself as ``garfield.mit.edu''.

     N:18.72.0.252::garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a Connection from host ``18.72.0.252'', and
     don't expect login password.  The connecting host should identify
     itself as ``garfield.mit.edu''.

     NN  ``N'' corresponds to a server Noconnect option.

     TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt AAddddrr
        Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
        to.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the
        server will require that the remote username returned by the
        ident server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.

     PPaasssswwoorrdd
        The password of the other host.  A password must always be
        present for the line to be recognized. If CRYPT_LINK_PASSWORD is

     TTAARRGGEETT HHoosstt NNAAMMEE
        The full hostname of the target machine. This is the name that
        the TARGET server will identify itself with when you connect to
        it.  If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi you would receive
        ``nic.funet.fi'' and that is what you should place in this
        field.

     WWiillddccaarrddss ddoommaaiinnss
        To reduce the great amount of servers in IRCnet wildcard DOMAINS
        were introduced in 2.6. To explain the usage of wildcard domains
        we take an example of such:

        *.de  - a domain name matching all machines in Germany.

        Wildcard domains are useful in that ALL SERVERS in Germany (or
        any other domain area) can be shown as one to the rest of the
        world. Imagine 100 servers in Germany, it would be incredible
        waste of netwotk bandwidth to broadcast all of them to all
        servers around the world.

        So wildcard domains are a great help, but how to use them ?

        They can be defined in the N-line for a given connection, in
        place of ``Domain Mask'' you write a magic number called
        wildcard count.

        Wildcard count tells you HOW MANY PARTS of your server's name
        should be replaced by a wildcard. For example, your server's
        name is ``tolsun.oulu.fi'' and you want to represent it as
        ``*.oulu.fi'' to ``nic.funet.fi''. In this case the wildcard
        count is 1, because only one word (tolsun) is replaced by a
        wildcard.

        If the wildcard count would be 2, then the wildcard domain would
        be ``*.fi''. Note that with wildcard name ``*.fi'' you could NOT
        connect to ``nic.funet.fi'' because that would result in a
        server name ccoolllliissiioonn (*.fi matches nic.funet.fi).

        I advice you to not to use wildcard servers before you know for
        sure how they are used, they are mostly beneficial for backbones
        of countries and other large areas with common domain.

        In direct contrast to L-lines, the server also implements H-
        lines to determine which servers may act as a hub and what they
        may ``hub for''.  If a server is only going to supply its own
        name (ie act as a solitary leaf) then no H-line is required for,

        To stop servers which should only act as leaves from hubs
        becoming hubs accidently, the L line was introduced so that hubs
        can be aware of which servers should and shouldnt be treated as
        leaves. A leaf server is supposed to remain a node for the
        entirity of its life whilst connected to the IRC server network.
        It is quite easy, however for a leaf server to be incorrectly
        setup and create problems by becoming a node of 2 or more
        servers, ending its life as a leaf. The L line enables the
        administrator of an IRC ``Hub server'' to ``stop'' a server
        which is meant to act as a leaf trying to make itself a hub.
        If, for example, the leaf server connects to another server
        which doesnt have an L-line for it, the one which does will drop
        the connection, once again making the server a leaf.

        the field checked against this max depth and if greater, the
        connection to the server that made its leaf too deep has its
        connection dropped.  For the L-line to come into effect, both
        fields, 2 and 4, must match up with the new server being

  Disallowing SERVERS in your irc net.

        In some cases people run into difficulties in net
        administration.  For one reason or another you do not want a
        certain server to be in your net (for example because of the
        security holes it opens for every server if it's not secured
        carefully). In that case you should use Q-lines in your server.
        When you specify a server name in Q-line, everytime some server
        link tries to introduce you a server (remember, all server names
        are broadcast around the net), that name is checked if it
        matches the Q-lines in your server. If it matches, then yyoouurr
        sseerrvveerr disconnects the link. Note that just placing Q-lines to
        your server probably results in yyoouurr sseerrvveerr being left alone,
