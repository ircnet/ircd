  This document describes how to install, and configure IRC 2.11.0.

  [1m1.  Installing IRC.[0m

  [1m1.1.  The configure script[0m

  This package uses a GNU configure script for its configuration.  You
  simply need to untar the distribution and run the ``configure''
  script.  This will run configure which will probe your system for any
  peculiarities it has and setup the Makefile and a file of default
  #define's ($arch/setup.h).

  There are a few options to ``configure'' to help it out, or change the
  default behaviour:

     [1m--prefix=DIR[0m
        changes the default directory into which ircd will install using
        ``make install''.  This defaults to /usr/local

     [1m--sbindir=DIR[0m
        changes the default directory where the system admin executable
        files will go. It is important to set this properly. (default is
        prefix/sbin)

     [1m--logdir=DIR[0m
        changes the default directory where the irc log files will go.
        (default is prefix/var/log/ircd)

     [1m--sysconfdir=DIR[0m
        changes the default directory where the irc server configuration
        files will go. (default is prefix/etc)

     [1m--localstatedir=DIR[0m
        changes the default directory where the irc server state files
        will go. (default is prefix/var/run)

     [1m--resconf=FILE[0m
        defines the file to be used by ircd to initialize its resolver.
        (default is /etc/resolv.conf)

     [1m--zlib-include=DIR[0m
        specifies in which directory the include file from the zlib is
        located.

     [1m--zlib-library=DIR[0m
        specifies in which directory the zlib library is located.

     [1m--zlib-prefix=DIR[0m
        specifies the prefix for zlib location.  It overrides the 2
        previous options.  (The include directory is supposed to be in
        prefix/include, and the library in prefix/lib).

     [1m--with-zlib[0m
        is the default.  ``configure'' looks on your system to find the
        zlib.  If found, ircd will be linked using it.  This does NOT
        mean you can use server link compression, for this you also need
        to define ZIP_LINKS (see section below).

     [1m--without-zlib[0m
        tells ``configure'' not to look for the zlib.  Defining this
        will keep you from using server link compression.

     [1m--enable-ip6[0m
        Enable IPv6 support (See notes below)

     [1m--enable-dsm[0m
        Enable Dynamically Shared Modules support for iauth


  [1m1.2.  Notes for Cygwin32 users[0m

  The daemon of 2.11.0 release compiles properly on W32 systems which
  have the GNU-Win32 environment ( <http://www.cygwin.com/>) setup.  At
  the time of the release, tests were made using the version b20.1 of
  the Cygwin32 library.

  When compiling on such system, you want to make sure that you have
  carefully followed the Cygwin32 installation notes.

  Also, the IRC server needs a [1mresolv.conf [22mfile in order to initialize
  the resolver.  This file can be anywhere (see configure options), and
  is typically in [1m/etc [22mon UNIX systems.


  [1m1.3.  Notes concerning IPv6 support[0m

  This version was tested on the following IPv6 systems: BSD/OS+KAME,
  Digital Unix, FreeBSD+KAME, Linux, NetBSD+INRIA.

  Because IPv6 numeric addresses contain ``:'' characters, [1mthe default[0m
  [1mseparator for the server configuration file was changed to ``%''[22m.


  [1m2.  The config.h file[0m

  The second step consists of defining options before the compilation.
  This is done by editing the ``config.h'' file and changing the various
  #DEFINE's.


  [1m2.1.  DEBUGMODE[0m

  [1mThis should only be defined for test purposes, and never used on a[0m
  [1mproduction server.[0m

  Define DEBUGMODE if you want to see the ircd debugging information as
  the daemon is running. Normally this function will be undefined as
  ircd produces a considerable amount of output.  DEBUGMODE must be
  defined for either of -t or -x command line options to work.  Defining
  this induces a large overhead for the server as it does a large amount
  of self diagnostics whilst running.


  [1m2.2.  CHROOTDIR[0m

  To use the CHROOTDIR feature, make sure it is #define'd and that the
  server is being run as root. Better use some other (external) way of
  setting up chroot environment for ircd and run it from there, not
  requiring to run as root.


  [1m2.3.  ENABLE_SUMMON, ENABLE_USERS[0m

  For security conscious server admins, they may wish to leave
  ENABLE_USERS undefined, disabling the USERS command which can be used
  to glean information the same as finger can.  ENABLE_SUMMON toggles
  whether the server will attempt to summon local users to irc by
  writing a message similar to that from talk(1) to a user's tty.
  [1m2.4.  SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS, NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE[0m

  On large IRC networks, the number of invisible users is likely to be
  large and reporting that number cause no pain.  To aid and effect
  this, SHOW_INVISIBLE_LUSERS is provided to cause the LUSERS command to
  report the number of invisible users to all people and not just
  operators.  The NO_DEFAULT_INVISIBLE define is used to toggle whether
  clients are automatically made invisible when they register.


  [1m2.5.  OPER_KILL, OPER_REHASH, OPER_RESTART, OPER_SET, LOCAL_KILL_ONLY[0m

  The three operator only commands, KILL, REHASH, RESTART and SET, may
  all be disabled to ensure that an operator who does not have the
  correct privilidges does not have the power to cause untoward things
  to occur. To further curb the actions of guest operators,
  LOCAL_KILL_ONLY can be defined to only allow locally connected clients
  to be KILLed.


  [1m2.6.  ZIP_LINKS, ZIP_LEVEL[0m

  As of the 2.9.3 version of the server, server-server connections may
  be compressed using the zlib.  In order to compile the server with
  this feature, you MUST have the zlib package (version 1.0 or higher)
  already compiled and define ZIP_LINKS in the config.h file.
  Compression use for server-server connections is separately configured
  in the ircd.conf file for each server-server link.  ZIP_LEVEL allows
  you to control the compression level that will be used.  Values above
  5 will noticeably increase the CPU used by the server.

  The zlib package may be found at  <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/>. The
  data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for
  Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
  <ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt> (zlib format), rfc1951.txt
  (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).


  [1m2.7.  SLOW_ACCEPT[0m

  This option is undefined by default, however is needed on some OSes.
  It creates an artificial delay in processing incoming connections.  On
  a given port, no more than 1 connection per 2 seconds will be
  processed.

  As it is undefined, it lets the server process connections as fast as
  it can which can cause problems on some OSes (such as SunOS) and be
  abused (fast massive join of clonebots..), for these reasons, if you
  decide to keep SLOW_ACCEPT undefined you MUST define CLONE_CHECK.


  [1m2.8.  CLONE_CHECK[0m

  This option is defined by default and acts as a wrapper, by checking
  incoming connections early before starting ident query.  By default,
  the server will not accept more than 10 connections from the same host
  within 2 seconds.


  [1m2.9.  Other #define's[0m

  The rest of the user changable #define's should be pretty much self
  explanatory in the config.h file.  It is *NOT* recommended that any of
  the file under the line with "STOP STOP" in it be changed.


  [1m3.  Editing the Makefile, and compiling[0m

  This package now uses GNU autoconf to probe your system and generate
  the correct Makefile.  However you may need to read it to check for
  values generated by the configure script.  In particular, all the
  filenames, and path for binaries, log files, configuration files and
  so on are defined there.  It is recommended to make use of the options
  described in the ``configure script'' section rather than to edit the
  generated Makefile.  However, these options do not provide a total
  control over these values, in which case you need to directly edit the
  Makefile.

  Now to build the package, type ``make all''.  If everything goes will,
  you can then install it by typing ``make install''.

  If you have trouble compiling ircd, copy Makefile.in to Makefile and
  edit Makefile as appropriate.


  [1m4.  The ircd.conf file[0m

  After installing the ircd and irc programs, edit the ircd.conf file as
  per the instructions in this section and install it in the location
  you specified in the config.h file.  There is a sample conf file
  called example.conf in the doc/ directory.

  Appendix A (See INSTALL.appendix) describes the differences between IP
  addresses and host names.  If you are unfamiliar with this, you should
  probably scan through it before proceeding.

  The ircd.conf file contains various records that specify configuration
  options.  The record types are as follows:

  1. Machine information   (M)

  2. Administrative info   (A)

  3. Port connections      (P)

  4. Connection Classes    (Y)

  5. Client connections    (I,i)

  6. Operator privileges   (O,o)

  7. Excluded accounts     (K,k)

  8. Server connections    (C,c,N)

  9. Deny auto-connections (D)

  10.
     Hub connections       (H)

  11.
     Leaf connections      (L)

  12.
     Version limitations   (V)

  13.
     Excluded machines     (Q)

  14.
     Service connections   (S)

  15.
     Bounce server         (B)

  Except for types ``M'' and ``A'', you are allowed to have multiple
  records of the same type.  In some cases, you can have concurrent
  records.  [1mIt is important to note that the last matching record will[0m
  [1mbe used[22m.  This is especially useful when setting up I records (client
  connections).


  [1m4.1.  Machine information[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        IRC needs to know a few things about your UNIX site, and the
        ``M'' command specifies this information for IRC.  The fomat of
        this command is:

     [1mFormat[0m

        M:<Server NAME>:<YOUR Internet IP#>:<Geographic Location>:<Port>:<SID>



     [1mM  [22m``M'' specifies a Machine description line

     [1mServer NAME[0m
        The name of YOUR server adding any Internet DOMAINNAME that
        might also be present. If this hostname can be resolved, the IP#
        found will be used to for outgoing connections.  Otherwise the
        default interface address of the host is used.  The server name
        may not be FQDN of another host.  (This means all outgoing
        connections will be done from the same IP#, even if your host
        has several IP#).

     [1mYOUR Internet IP#[0m
        If the machine on which you run the server has several IP
        addresses, you can define which IP# to use for outgoing
        connections.  This overrides overrides the ``Server NAME''.

        See Also the ``Port Connections'' and ``Server Connections''
        sections.

     [1mGeographic Location[0m
        Geographic Location is used to say WHERE YOUR SERVER is, and
        gives people in other parts of the world a good idea of where
        you are!  If your server is in the USA, it is usually best to
        say: <CITY> <STATE>, USA.  Like for Denver I say: ``Denver
        Colorado, USA''.  Finnish sites (like tolsun.oulu.fi generally
        say something like ``Oulu, Finland''.

     [1mPort[0m
        Defines the port on which your server will listen for UDP pings
        from other servers.  This should be the port were other servers
        are set to autoconnect.  (Also see the port field description in
        connect lines).

     [1mSID[0m
        Defines Server ID, network-wide unique identifier of your
        server. It must begin with a digit. This must be set with
        cooperation of other servers' admins. On IRCnet you must consult
        your coord and/or admins of your peers.

     [1mExample:[0m
        M:tolsun.oulu.fi::Oulu, Finland:6667:00PA

        This line reads: My Host's name is ``tolsun.oulu.fi'', my site
        is located in ``Oulu, Finland'' and my SID is ``00PA''.

        M:orion.cair.du.edu::Denver Colorado, USA:6667:00PS

        This line reads: My Hosts name is ``orion.cair.du.edu'', my site
        is located in ``Denver Colorado, USA'' and my SID is ``00PS''.

     [1mNote[0m
        Using ``*'' as <Your Internet IP> allows OS to choose best
        outgoing source IP. See also [1mServer Connections [22msection for
        configuring source IP of outgoing connections.



  [1m4.2.  Administrative info[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        The ``A'' line is used for administrative information about a
        site. The e-mail address of the person running the server should
        be included here in case problems arise.

     [1mFormat[0m

        A:<Your Name/Location>:<Your E-Mail Addr>:<other>::<network name>



     [1mA  [22mThis specifies an Admin record.

     [1mYour Name & Location[0m
        Use this field to say tell your FULL NAME and where in the world
        your machine is.  Be sure to add your City, State/Province and
        Country.

     [1mYour Electronix Mailing Addr[0m
        Use this field to specify your Electronic Mailing Address
        preferably your Internet Mailing Address.  If you have a UUCP or
        ARAPnet address - please add that as well.  Be sure to add any
        extra DOMAIN information that is needed, for example ``mail
        jtrim@orion'' probably won't work as a mail address to me if you
        happen to be in Alaska.  But ``mail jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu''
        would work because you know that ``orion'' is part of the DOMAIN
        ``cair.du.edu''.  So be sure to add your DOMAINNAMES to your
        mailing addresses.

     [1mOther[0m
        This is really an OTHER field - you can add what you want here.

     [1mNetwork name[0m
        Use this field to announce your network name in 005 numerics.
        Use only one word!

     [1mExample[0m
        (the line is just one line in the confuration file, here it is
        cut into two lines to make it clearer to read):

        A:Jeff Trim -  Denver Colorado, USA:INET jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu
        UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim:Terve! Heippa!  Have you said hello
        in Finnish today?;)::IRCnet

        Would look like this when printed out with the /admin command:

        Jeff Trim -  Denver Colorado, USA INET jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu
        UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim Terve! Hei! Heippa!  Have you said
        hello in Finnish today? ;)


        Note that the A record cannot be split across multiple lines; it
        will typically be longer than 80 characters and will therefore
        wrap around the screen.


  [1m4.3.  Port connections[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        The port line adds flexibility to the server's ability to accept
        connections. By use of this line in the ircd.conf file, it is
        easy to setup both Unix Domain ports for the server to accept
        connections on as well as extra internet ports.

     [1mFormat[0m

        P:<Internet IP#>:::<Port>::<Flags>
        P:<Directory>:::<Port>::<Flags>



  +o  Internet Ports

     [1mInternet IP#[0m
        If the host on which the server runs has several IP addresses,
        you can define for which IP address connections will be
        accepted. If none is defined here, server will bind to all
        interfaces (INADDR_ANY).  See also [1mMachine configuration [22mand
        [1mServer Connections [22msections to properly configure outgoing
        connections.

     [1mPort[0m
        The port number field tells the server which port number it
        should listen on for incoming connections.

     [1mExample[0m
        P:192.168.1.194:::6664:

        Listens for incoming connections on IP 192.168.1.194, port 6664.

  +o  Unix Socket Ports.

     [1mDirectory[0m
        The path set in this field should be the directory name in which
        to create the unix socket for later listening to. The server
        will attempt to create the directory before creating the unix
        socket.

     [1mPort[0m
        The port field when used in combination with a pathname in a P-
        line is the filename created in the directory set in the first
        field.

     [1mExample[0m
        P:/tmp/.ircd:::6667:

        Creates a unix socket in the /tmp/.ircd directory called
        ``6667''. The unix socket (file) must be a numerical.


     [1mFlags[0m
        Flags changing behaviour of a given P-line. It can be empty or
        one of:

        +o  D - delayed accept (not active until first netjoin)

        +o  S - server-only (user connections are rejected)

     [1mNote[0m
        You need at least one P-line or server won't start.  (Unless you
        run it from inetd.)


  [1m4.4.  Connection Classes[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        To enable more efficient use of MAXIMUM_LINKS, connection
        classes were implemented.  All clients belong to a connection
        class.

        Each line for a server should have the same number as the sixth
        field.  If it is absent, the server deaults it to 0, using the
        defaults from the config.h file.

        To define a connection class, you need to include a Y: line in
        the ircd.conf file.  This enables you to define the ping
        frequency, connection frequency (for servers) and maximum number
        of links that class should have.

        Currently, the Y: line [1mMUST [22mappear in the ircd.conf file [1mBEFORE[0m
        it is used in any other way.

     [1mFormat[0m

        Y:<Class>:<Ping Freq>:<Connect Freq>:<Max Links>:<SendQ>:<Local Limit>:<Global Limit>



     [1mY  [22mThis specifies a Class record.

     [1mClass[0m
        This is the class number which gains the following attributes
        and should match that which is on the end of the C/c/N/I/O/S
        line.

     [1mPing Frequency[0m
        This field defines how long the server will let the connection
        remain ``silent'' before sending a PING message to make sure it
        is still alive.  Unless you are sure of what you are doing, use
        the default value which is in your config.h file.

     [1mConnect Frequency[0m
        By changing this number, you change how often your server checks
        to see if it can connect to this server. If you want to check
        very occasionally, use a large value, but if it is an important
        connection, you might want a smaller value so that you
        autoconnect to it as soon as possible.

     [1mMax Links[0m
        This field defines the maximum number of links this class will
        allow from automatic connections (C lines).  Using /CONNECT
        overrides this feature.  Also defines the maximum number of
        users in this class for I/O lines per I/O line.

     [1mSendQ[0m
        This field defines the ``SendQ'' value for this class.  If this
        field is not present, the default (from config.h) is assigned.
     [1mLocal limit[0m
        This field is used to limit the number of local concurrent
        connections.  The format is <x>.<y>

        +o  x: defines the maximum number of clients from the same host
           (IP) will be allowed.

        +o  y: defines the maximum number of clients from the same
           user@host (IP) will be allowed.  Read note below.

        Any unset value defaults to 1 (one).

     [1mGlobal limit[0m
        This field has the same use as the ``Local limit'' field.  But,
        the connection counts are done for all clients present on the
        net instead of only counting local clients.

     [1mNote[0m
        leaving any of the fields (except SendQ and limits) out means
        their value is 0 (ZERO)!!  The SendQ field default value is
        dynamically determined. Limits default to 1.1 (one connection).

     [1mNote[0m
        If you plan to use the local user@host limit, please read the
        following very carefully.  The ``user'' value is the ident reply
        for the connection.  If no reply was given then it defaults to
        ``unknown'' and thus the effective limit will be per host, not
        per user@host. Also, some ident servers return encrypted data
        which changes for every connection making the limit void.

     [1mNote[0m
        Only the local limitation is accurate.

     [1mNote[0m
        If you define a gobal limit, you should also define a local
        limit (same or lower) as it won't take more CPU and will make
        the global limit more accurate.

     [1mNote[0m
        The local and global limits only affect users (I lines), not
        servers nor services.

     [1mExample[0m
        Y:23:120:300:5:800000:0:0: (server class)

        This defines class 23 to allow 5 auto-connections, which are
        checked every 300 seconds.  The connection is allowed to remain
        silent for 120 seconds before a PING is sent.  NOTE: fields 3 &
        4 are in seconds.  The SendQ is set to 800000 bytes.

        Y:1:60:0:50:20000:2:5: (client class)

        In case of a client class, the fields are interpreted a bit
        differently.  This class (number 1) can be used by up to 50
        users.  The connections are allowed to remain silent for 60
        seconds before a PING is set.  The SendQ is set to 20000 bytes.
        A new connection in this class will only be allowed if there
        aren't more than 2 other local connections from the same IP
        address, or more than 5 other connections on the net from the
        same hostname.

        Y:2:60:0:50:20000:2.1:5: (client class)

        In case of a client class, the fields are interpreted a bit
        differently.  This class (number 1) can be used by up to 50
        users.  The connections are allowed to remain silent for 60
        seconds before a PING is set.  The SendQ is set to 20000 bytes.
        A new connection in this class will only be allowed if there
        aren't more than 2 other local connections from the same IP
        address, 1 local connection from the same user from the same IP
        address, or more than 5 other connections on the net from the
        same hostname.


  [1m4.5.  Client connections[0m

  How to let clients connect to your IRCD.

     [1mIntroduction[0m
        A client is a program that connects to the ircd daemon (ircd).
        There are clients written in C, GNU Emacs Lisp and many other
        languages.  The ``irc'' program is the C client.  Each person
        that talks via IRC is running their own client.

        The ircd.conf files contains entries that specify which clients
        are allowed to connect to your irc daemon.  Obviously you want
        to allow your own machine's clients to connect.  You may want to
        allow clients from other sites to connect.  These remote clients
        will use your server as a connection point.  All messages sent
        by these clients will pass through your machine.

     [1mFormat[0m

        I:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Hosts NAME>:<Port>:<Class>:<Flags>



     [1mNote[0m
        Lower case ``i'' is equal to an ``R'' flag in plain ``I''.
        Lower case ``i'' will be removed in the next version.

     [1mTARGET Host Addr[0m
        Specifies the IP address(es) of the machine(s) that are allowed
        to connect.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual IP address the
        server will require that the remote username returned by the
        ident server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.
        Wildcards are permitted unless using a bitmask (e.g.
        1.2.3.0/24). Note that bitmask are encouraged over wildcards, as
        they are more accurate.

        Empty field is equal to '*' (matches any).

     [1mPassword[0m
        The password that must be given by the client to be allowed on
        the server.

     [1mTARGET Host NAME[0m
        Specifies the host name(s) of the machines allowed to connect to
        the server.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual name the server
        will require that the remote username returned by the ident
        server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.  Wildcards
        are permitted, but [1mplease [22mrather leave this field empty and use
        bitmask in [1mHost Addr [22mfield.

        Empty field matches any. ``*'' also matches any, but it requires
        working DNS for a client.

        Using this field to enforce that clients have no Host Name set
        is not working (they will rather be denied connection). Use
        ``N'' [1mflag[22m.


     [1mPort[0m
        Specifies the port number for which this configuration line is
        valid.  An empty field, or ``0'' matches all ports.

     [1mClass[0m
        This field should refer to an existing class.  Connections
        classes are usefull to limit the number of users allowed on the
        server.

     [1mFlags[0m
        This field contains flags of an I:line; flags are one character
        in size, can be combined and their order does not matter.

        +o  E - client is exempted from K: lines

        +o  F - fall-through to next I:line if password did not match

        +o  R - restricted

        +o  I - restricted, when client has no ident.

        +o  D - restricted, when client has no reverse DNS

        +o  M - disable resolved host name to be shown

        +o  N - disable resolved host name to be used

     [1mNote[0m
        Restricted I: line means that clients matching such I line will
        not be able to use their operator privileges (no nick/mode
        change, no kick). Such users will also have their username
        prefixed by +, = or - depending on the ident reply.


     [1mNote[0m
        The server checks if the client hostname matches the [1mTARGET Host[0m
        [1mNAME [22mfield.  If a match is found, server checks [1mTARGET Host Addr[0m
        field.  If a match is found, the client is accepted. Clients
        host is set either to its hostname (if available) or, using
        ``N'' or ``M'' flag, to its IP.

     [1mNote[0m
        The difference between ``M'' and ``N'' flags is simple: after
        host resolving and I:line matching is done, ``M'' keeps hostname
        and uses it for matching in beIR modes and printing in logs,
        while ``N'' discards it completely.

     [1mExamples[0m
        For example, if you were installing IRC on tolsun.oulu.fi and
        you wanted to let your own clients to connect to your server,
        you would add this entry to the file:

        I:::tolsun.oulu.fi::1

        If you wanted to let remote clients connect, you could add the
        following line:

        I:::*.edu.edu::1

        and allow any clients from machines whose names end in
        ``.edu.edu'' to connect with no password.

        I:128.214.6.100::nic.funet.fi::1

        Allow clients from a machine with that IP number [1mand [22mthat
        hostname to connect.
        I::secret:*.tut.fi::1

        Allow clients from machines matching ``*.tut.fi'' to connect
        with the password ``secret''.

        I:::*::1

        Allow anyone from anywhere to connect to your server.

        I:::*.fi:6667:1

        Allow clients from machines matching ``*.fi'' to connect on the
        port 6667.

        I:135.11.35.0/24::*.net::1

  [1m4.6.  Operator priviliges[0m

  How to become the IRC administrator on your site

     [1mIntroduction[0m
        To become an IRC Administrator, IRC must know who is authorized
        to become an operator and what their ``Nickname'' and
        ``Password'' is.

     [1mFormat[0m

        O:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Password>:<Nickname>:<Port>:<Class>



     [1mO  [22mSpecifies Operator record.

     [1mNote[0m
        If you use small letter (``o'') in it, it specifies a global
        operator. Capital letter (``O'') specifies a local operator.
        Local operator has basically the same rights except global
        operator with some restrictions.

     [1mTARGET Host NAME[0m
        Tells IRC which host you have the privileges FROM.  This means
        that you should be logged into this host when you ask for the
        priviliges.  If you specify ``tolsun.oulu.fi'' then IRC will
        expect your CLIENT to be connected at ``tolsun.oulu.fi'' - when
        you ask for OPERATOR privileges from ``tolsun.oulu.fi''.  You
        cannot be logged in at any other host and be able to use your
        OPERATOR privileges at tolsun, only when you are connected at
        TOLSUN will this work - this is a safeguard against unauthorized
        sites.

     [1mPassword[0m
        If your AUTHORIZATION Password - this is the password that let's
        IRC know you are who you say you are!  Never tell anyone your
        password and always keep the ``ircd.conf'' file protected from
        all of the other users.

     [1mNickname[0m
        The Nickname you usually go by - but you can make this what you
        want.

     [1mPort[0m
        Unused.

     [1mClass[0m
        The class field should refer to an existing class (preferably
        having a lower number than that for the relevant I-line) and
        determines the maximum number of simultaneous uses of the O-line
        allowable through the max. links field in the Y-line.

     [1mExample[0m
        o:orion.cair.du.edu:pyunxc:Jeff::1

        There is an OPERATOR at ``orion.cair.du.edu'' that can get
        Operator priviliges if he specifies a password of ``pyunxc'' and
        uses a NICKNAME of ``Jeff''.

     [1mNote[0m
        Host NAME accepts IP bitmasks.


  [1m4.7.  Excluded accounts[0m

  Remove an errant user from IRC on your site.

     [1mIntroduction[0m
        Obviously it is hoped that you wouldn't have to use this
        command.  Unfortunately sometimes a user can become unmanageable
        and this is your only recourse - the KILL USER command.  THIS
        COMMAND ONLY AFFECTS YOUR SERVER - If this user can connect to
        another SERVER somewhere else in the IRC-Network then you would
        have to talk to the administrator on that site to disable his
        access from that IRCD Server as well.

     [1mFormat[0m

        K:<Host Name>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<User>:<port>:
        k:<Host Name>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<Auth>:<port>:



     [1mK  [22m``K'' tells the IRCD that you are making a KILL USER command
        entry.

     [1mHost Name[0m
        In this field you specify the Hostname or the IP address (Single
        IP, Wildcard notation or bitmask notation) that the user is
        connecting from.  If you wanted to REMOVE connects to IRC from
        ``orion.cair.du.edu'' then you would want to enter
        ``orion.cair.du.edu''.  If you want to REMOVE ALL HOSTS access
        you can use ``*'' (Wild Card notation) and no matter what host
        the USERNAME (specified in Field 4) connects from s/he will be
        denied access.

        If you specify an IP address, IP mask, or an IP bitmask, it will
        match clients connecting from the matching addresses, no matter
        if they resolve or not.

        You can prefix an IP address, an IP mask, or IP bitmask by ``=''
        in which case only non resolving matching hosts will be banned.

     [1mtime interval(s)|comment[0m
        Either leave this field empty or put a comment, then the line
        active continuously for the specified user/host machine.  You
        may also specify intervals during the line should be active, see
        examples below.

     [1mUser[0m
        The USERNAME of the user you want removed from IRC.  For example
        ``root''.

     [1mAuth[0m
        If the user's ident server replies with the OTHER type (as
        opposed to the UNIX type), the reply is not used to set the
        user's username.  (lowercase) k lines can be used in these case
        to reject users based on their ident reply.

        This field will be matched against the ident server reply.  It
        is important to note that OTHER replies are prefixed with a
        ``-'' by the ircd, while UNIX replies are not.

     [1mPort[0m
        The port on which the Kill line will be effective. 0 means all

        If user ``jtrim'' connects to IRC from host
        ``orion.cair.du.edu'' then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE HIM from my IRCD.

        k:*.stealth.net::-43589:0:

        If a user connects from any host that has the suffix
        ``stealth.net'' and if that host ident server returns ``-43589''
        - then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THEM from my IRCD.

        will NEVER allow username ``vijay'' to login to my IRCD.''

        K:*.oulu.fi:0800-1200,1400-1900:*:0:

        This disallows all users from hosts with enddomain ``oulu.fi''
        access to your server between 8 and 12am, 2 and 7pm. Users get
        kicked off if they're already signed on when the line becomes
        active (they'll get a warning 5 minutes before). Note that this
        requires ircd to be compiled with proper #define!

        K:192.11.35.0/24::*:0:

        This line disallows all hosts whose IP address is from network
        ``192.11.35.0/24'' to login to the ircd.

  [1m4.8.  Server connections[0m

  How to connect to other servers, How other servers can connect to you

  [1mWARNING: [22mThe hostnames used as examples are really only examples and
  not meant to be used (simply because they don't work) in real life.


  Now you must decide WHICH hosts you want to connect to and WHAT ORDER
  you want to connect to them in.  For my example let us assume I am on
  the machine "rieska.oulu.fi" and I want to connect to irc daemons on 3
  other machines:

  +o  ``garfield.mit.edu''        - Tertiary Connection

  +o  ``irc.nada.kth.se''         - Secondary Connection

  +o  ``nic.funet.fi''            - Primary Connection


  And I prefer to connect to them in that order, meaning I first want to
  try connecting to ``nic.funet.fi'', then to ``irc.nada.kth.edu'', and
  finally to ``garfield.mit.edu''.  So if ``nic.funet.fi'' is down or
  unreachable, the program will try to connect to ``irc.nada.kth.se''.
  If irc.nada.kth.se is down it will try to connect to garfield and so
  forth.

  PLEASE limit the number of hosts you will attempt to connect to down
  to 3. This is because of two main reasons:

  1. to save your server from causing extra load and delays to users

  2. to save internet from extra network traffic (remember the old rwho
     program with traffic problems when the number of machines
     increased).


     [1mFormat[0m

        C:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<TARGET PORT>:<Class>:<Source IP>

     - or -

     C:root@nic.funet.fi:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1


     [1mC  [22mThis field tells the IRC program which option is being
        configured. "C" corresponds to a server Connect option.

     [1mTARGET Host Addr[0m
        Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
        to.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the
        server will require that the remote username returned by the
        ident server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.

     [1mPassword[0m

        present for the line to be recognized.

     [1mTARGET Host NAME[0m
        The full hostname of the target machine. This is the name that
        the TARGET server will identify itself with when you connect to
        it.  If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi you would receive
        ``nic.funet.fi'' and that is what you should place in this
        field.

     [1mTARGET PORT[0m
        The INTERNET Port that you want to connect to on the TARGET
        machine. Most of the time this will be set to ``6667''.  If this
        field is left blank, then no connections will be attempted to
        the TARGET host, and your host will accept connections FROM the
        TARGET host instead.  The port field can contain 2 ports,
        separated by a . In this case, the first port is used when auto-
        connecting, the second port is used for the UDP pings to the
        targer server.

     [1mClass[0m
        The class field should refer to an existing class and determines
        the maximum number of simultaneous uses of the C-line allowable
        through the max. links field in the Y-line.

     [1mSource IP[0m
        This field specifies source IP to use for connects to this
        server.

     [1mCompressed links[0m
        Server connections can be compressed with the zlib library.  To
        define a compressed connection, you must have compiled the
        server with ZIP_LINKS defined, and use a _lowercase_ C line.

     [1mNEW!!![0m
        As of the 2.11.0 version of the server, [1mSource IP [22mfield has been
        added.

  Some examples:

  +o  C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     This reads: Connect to host ``nic.funet.fi'', with no password and
     expect this server to identify itself to you as ``nic.funet.fi''.
     Your machine will connect to this host to port 6667.

  +o  C:18.72.0.252:Jeff:garfield.mit.edu:6667:1:192.168.0.18

     This reads: Connect to a host at address ``18.72.0.252'', using a
     password of ``Jeff''.  The TARGET server should identify itself as
     ``garfield.mit.edu''.  You will connect to Internet Port 6667 on
     this host. This connection will use (your) source IP of
     ``192.168.0.18''.

  +o  C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:1

     This reads: do not attempt to autoconnect to ``irc.nada.kth.se'',
     but if ``irc.nada.kth.se'' requests a connection, allow it to
     connect.

  Now back to our original problem, we wanted OUR server CONNECT to 3
  hosts,  ``nic.funet.fi'', ``irc.nada.kth.se'' and ``garfield.mit.edu''
  in that order.  So as we enter these entries into the file they must
  be done in [1mreverse [22morder of how we could want to connect to them.

  Here's how it would look if we connected ``nic.funet.fi'' first:

  C:garfield.mit.edu::garfield.mit.edu:6667:1
  C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:6667:1
  C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1

  Ircd will attempt to connect to nic.funet.fi first, then to irc.nada
  and finally to garfield.

  [1mReciprocal entries: [22mEach ``C'' entry requires a corresponding ``N''
  entry that specifies connection priviliges to other hosts.  The ``N''
  entry contains the password, if any, that you require other hosts to
  have before they can connect to you.  These entries are of the same
  format as the ``C'' entries.



     [1mFormat[0m
        The format for the NOCONNECT entry in the ``ircd.conf'' is:

        N:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Domain Mask>:<Class>



     Let us assume that ``garfield.mit.edu'' connects to your server and
     you want to place password authorization authorization on garfield.
     The ``N'' entry would be:

     N:garfield.mit.edu:golden:garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a connection from host ``garfield.mit.edu'',
     and expect a login password of ``golden'', and expect the host to
     identify itself as ``garfield.mit.edu''.

     N:18.72.0.252::garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a Connection from host ``18.72.0.252'', and
     don't expect login password.  The connecting host should identify
     itself as ``garfield.mit.edu''.

     [1mN  [22m``N'' corresponds to a server Noconnect option.

     [1mTARGET Host Addr[0m
        Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
        to.  If ``user@'' prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the
        server will require that the remote username returned by the
        ident server be the same as the one given before the ``@''.

     [1mPassword[0m
        The password of the other host.  A password must always be
        present for the line to be recognized. If CRYPT_LINK_PASSWORD is
        defined in config.h, this password must be crypted.
     [1mTARGET Host NAME[0m
        The full hostname of the target machine. This is the name that
        the TARGET server will identify itself with when you connect to
        it.  If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi you would receive
        ``nic.funet.fi'' and that is what you should place in this

        To reduce the great amount of servers in IRCnet wildcard DOMAINS
        were introduced in 2.6. To explain the usage of wildcard domains
        we take an example of such:

        *.de  - a domain name matching all machines in Germany.

        Wildcard domains are useful in that ALL SERVERS in Germany (or
        any other domain area) can be shown as one to the rest of the
        world. Imagine 100 servers in Germany, it would be incredible
        waste of network bandwidth to broadcast all of them to all
        servers around the world.

        So wildcard domains are a great help, but how to use them ?

        They can be defined in the N-line for a given connection, in
        place of ``Domain Mask'' you write a magic number called
        wildcard count.

        Wildcard count tells you HOW MANY PARTS of your server's name
        should be replaced by a wildcard. For example, your server's
        name is ``tolsun.oulu.fi'' and you want to represent it as
        ``*.oulu.fi'' to ``nic.funet.fi''. In this case the wildcard
        count is 1, because only one word (tolsun) is replaced by a
        wildcard.

        If the wildcard count would be 2, then the wildcard domain would
        be ``*.fi''. Note that with wildcard name ``*.fi'' you could NOT
        connect to ``nic.funet.fi'' because that would result in a
        server name [1mcollision [22m(*.fi matches nic.funet.fi).

        I advise you to not to use wildcard servers before you know for
        sure how they are used, they are mostly beneficial for backbones
        of countries and other large areas with common domain.



  [1m4.9.  Deny auto-connections[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        D lines were implemented to give server administrators more
        control on how auto connections are done.  This will most likely
        only be useful for big networks which have complex
        configurations.

     [1mFormat[0m

        D:<Denied Server Mask>:Denied Class:<Server Name>:Server Class:



     [1mDenied Server Mask[0m
        This field is matched against all servers currently present on
        the network.

     [1mDenied Class[0m
        If this field contains a class number, it will match if any
        server in that class is currently present on the network.  Note
        that this can be true for any server, even the ones not directly
        connected.

     [1mServer Mask[0m
        This field is matched against the server name that the server
        wants to auto connect to.

     [1mServer Class[0m
        This field is used to match against the class to which belong
        the servers for which an autoconnect is set.

     [1mExamples[0m
        D:*.edu::*.fi::

        Don't auto-connect to any ``*.fi'' server if any server present
        on the network matches ``*.edu''.

        D::2:eff.org:3:

        Do not auto-connect to ``eff.org'', or any server in class ``3''
        if a server defined to be in class ``2'' is currently present on
        the network.


  [1m4.10.  Hub connections[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        In direct contrast to L-lines, the server also implements H-
        lines to determine which servers may act as a hub and what they
        may ``hub for''.  If a server is only going to supply its own
        name (ie act as a solitary leaf) then no H-line is required for,
        else a H-line must be added.

     [1mFormat[0m

        H:<Server Mask>:<SID Mask>:<Server Name>::



     [1mServer Mask[0m
        All servers that are allowed via this H-line must match the mask
        given in this field.

     [1mSID Mask[0m
        SIDs of all servers that are allowed via this H-line must match
        the mask given in this field. Empty field is equal to '*', that
        is any SID is allowed to be introduced.

     [1mServer Name[0m
        This field is used to match exactly against a server name,
        wildcards being treated as literal characters.

     [1mExamples[0m
        H:*.edu::*.bu.edu::

        Allows a server named ``*.bu.edu'' to introduce only servers
        that match the ``*.edu'' name mask, no matter what SID they
        have.
        H:*:616*:eff.org::

        Allows ``eff.org'' to introduce (and act as a hub for) any
        server which SID begins with ``616''.

     [1mNote[0m
        It is possible to have and use multiple H-lines (or L-lines) for
        the one server.  eg:


        H:*.edu:*:*.bu.edu::
        H:*.au:*:*.bu.edu::



     is allowed as is


     L:*.edu:*:*.au::
     L:*.com:*:*.au::



  [1m4.11.  Leaf connections[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        To stop servers which should only act as leaves from hubs
        becoming hubs accidently, the L line was introduced so that hubs
        can be aware of which servers should and shouldnt be treated as
        leaves. A leaf server is supposed to remain a node for the
        entirity of its life whilst connected to the IRC server network.
        It is quite easy, however for a leaf server to be incorrectly
        setup and create problems by becoming a node of 2 or more
        servers, ending its life as a leaf. The L line enables the
        administrator of an IRC ``Hub server'' to ``stop'' a server
        which is meant to act as a leaf trying to make itself a hub.
        If, for example, the leaf server connects to another server
        which doesnt have an L-line for it, the one which does will drop
        the connection, once again making the server a leaf.

     [1mFormat[0m

        L:<Server Mask>:*:<Server Name>:<Max Depth>:



     [1mServer Mask[0m
        Mask of which servers the leaf-like attributes are used on when
        the server receives SERVER messages.  The wildcards * and ? may
        be used within this field for matching purposes.  If this field
        is empty, it acts the same as if it were a single * (ie matches
        everything).

     [1mServer Name[0m
        The name of the server connected to you that for which you want
        to enforce leaf-like attributes upon.

     [1mMax Depth[0m
        Maximum depth allowed on that leaf and if not specified, a value
        of 1 is assumed.  The depth is checked each time a SERVER
        message is received by the server, the hops to the server being
        the field checked against this max depth and if greater, the
        connection to the server that made its leaf too deep has its
        connection dropped.  For the L-line to come into effect, both
        fields, 2 and 4, must match up with the new server being
        introduced and the server which is responsible for introducing
        this new server.


  [1m4.12.  Version limitations[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m

  Disallowing SERVERS in your irc net.

     [1mIntroduction[0m
        In some cases people run into difficulties in net
        administration.  For one reason or another you do not want a
        certain server to be in your net (for example because of the
        security holes it opens for every server if it's not secured
        carefully). In that case you should use Q-lines in your server.
        When you specify a server name in Q-line, everytime some server
        link tries to introduce you a server (remember, all server names
        are broadcast around the net), that name is checked if it
        matches the Q-lines in your server. If it matches, then [1myour[0m
        [1mserver [22mdisconnects the link. Note that just placing Q-lines to
        your server probably results in [1myour server [22mbeing left alone,
        unless other servers have agreed to have the same Q-line in
        their ircd configuration files as well.

     [1mExample[0m
        Q::of the security holes:foo.bar.baz::

        This command excludes a server named ``foo.bar.baz'', the reason
        is given to be security holes (you should give a reason, it is
        polite). The first field is unused, so leave it empty.


  [1m4.14.  Service connections[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        The Service is a special kind of IRC client. It does not have
        the full abilities of a normal user but can behave in a more
        active manner than a normal client.

        Services are not intended for interactive usage, and are better
        suited for automated clients.

     [1mFormat[0m

        S:<TARGET Host Mask>:<Password>:<Service Name>:<Service Type>:<Class>



     [1mTARGET Host Mask[0m
        The host mask should be set to match the host(s) from which the
        service will be connecting from. This may be either an IP# or
        full name (prefered).

     [1mPassword[0m
        This is the password which must be passed in the SERVICE
        command.

     [1mService Name[0m
        The name used by the service. Services don't have nicknames, but
        a static name defined by the S line.

     [1mService Type[0m
        The type of service. It defines the priviledges given to the
        service. Be very careful in the types you allow.  The types can
        be found in include/service.h
     [1mClass[0m
        The class field should refer to an existing class.

     [1mNotes[0m
        A service is not a very useful sort of client, it cannot join
        channels or issue certain commands although most are available
        to it. Services are rejected upon sending an unknown or
        unallowed command. Services however, are not affected by flood
        control and can be granted special privileges. It is therefore
        [1mwise to oversee the use of S-lines with much care.[0m


  [1m4.15.  Bounce server[0m


     [1mIntroduction[0m
        This provides you a way to bounce clients to another server.
        This information is provided to clients which are denied
        connection, either because their connection class is full, or
        the server is full, or they are not authorized to connect.

     [1mFormat[0m

        B:<Class|Host Mask>::<Server Name>:<Port>:



     [1mB  [22mThis specifies a Bounce record.

     [1mClass|Host Mask[0m
        This field specifies to which client this configuration line
        applies to.  It can be either a connection class number, a host
        mask to be matched against the client's hostname, or an IP
        address/mask/bitmask to be matched against the client's IP
        address.

        When the server is completely full, it rejects clients with the
        ``All connections in use'' message.  In this case, the server
        doesn't process the connections at all, and has no knowledge of
        the client's host name, or class number.  For these cases, this
        field must be empty.

     [1mNote[0m
        Class number ``-1'' is used for rejecting clients that use wrong
        (server-only) port.

     [1mServer Name[0m
        This specifies the IRC server hostname that the client should
        use.

     [1mPort[0m
        This specifies the IRC server port that the client should
        connect to.

     [1mExample[0m
        B:2::irc.stealth.net:6660:

        Rejected clients in class 2 are advised to use
        ``irc.stealth.net'' on port 6660.

        B:*.fi::irc.funet.fi:6667:

        Finnish client should use irc.funet.fi when they cannot be taken
        anymore.

        B:::irc2.stealth.net:6667:
        When the server is completely full, clients should use the
        secondary server.

        B:-1::our.server.example:6667:

        Clients that connected to server-only port should really use
        port 6667.
