  STATS unleashed

  This document describes all STATS for ircd server 2.11.

  11..  IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn

  So far STATS has one-char parameter. The result always ends with 219
  numeric ,,End of STATS report''. Whether it was empty output or
  invalid parameter can be determined by the char in 219 numeric (after
  the nickname): if it is the char we passed as parameter, the output
  was empty, if it was asterisk ,,*'', there was no such STATS we
  requested.

  Note: 2.11.2 allows multi-char parameters (there's one such so far).


  22..  SSTTAATTSS uunnlleeaasshheedd

  All examples are raw ircd output minus prefix (server name), numeric
  (varies from stats to stats) and nickname of a client requesting
  STATS. Also ending 219 numeric is omitted in whole.

     2nd field is class number or the hostname/IP mask to match the
     client; if NULL, it matches any class or hostname, if ``-1'', it is
     used only for those clients that were rejected for connecting to
     server-only port.  4th is server name and 5th the port, both
     telling the client where it should connect to.

          C *@192.168.0.13 * *.example.net 6667 10



     ``C'' or ``c'' (lowercase is a mark for zipped links) are connect
     lines, that is the list of servers we will connect to. 2nd field is
     remote server IP (or name), 3rd the password for connection (dis-
     guised as ``*''), 4th IRC name of a server, 5th -- port that auto-
     connection will be attempted to (non-positive disables A/C) and
     finally the class this server will be using is in 6th field.



          N *@192.168.0.13 * *.example.net 1 10



     ``N'' stands for no-connect lines, and these are the servers that
     will connect to us. It is required that each ``C'' has its corre-
     sponding ``N''.  The format is the same as ``C'' with an exception
     of last but one field: it is not a port, but a number of labels
     (parts of hostname between dots) from start to replace with ``*''
     when introducing us to this server (allows masking).

     For security reasons it is available to operators only. The meaning
     of fields is: file descriptor number, local ip, local port, client
     ip, client port, client nick, client auth (ident), idle.

     Hub line define what servers (2nd field) and what SIDs (3rd field)
     are allowed to be introduced by the server specified in 4th field.



          L * * leaf.example.org 0 :-1



     Leaf line ensures that servers we are connected to (matching 4th
     field) do not become hubs introducing us servers matching the mask
     (2nd field). 3th field is ignored, 5th field is max depth.



          D *.org <NULL> <NULL> 99 :0



     Deny autoconnect to servers that names match 4th field or that are
     in a class specified by 5th field if any of the servers matching
     2nd field or defined to be in class specified in 3rd field are cur-
     rently present on the network or, if 2nd field prefixed with ``!'',
     denies autoconnect if none of the servers matching 2nd field is
     present on the network.

          I 127.0.0.1 <NULL> <NULL> 0 10 -



     2nd field is an IP address, IP mask or CIDR, 3rd is password (dis-
     guised by ``*'' if present), 4th is a hostname required to match,
     5th is a port this line is valid for, 6th is the class client will
     be put in and finally 7th field is I-line flags (all explained in
     the INSTALL file). 2nd and 4th fields can be prefixed by ``user@'',
     which means ident must match as well.

          K pc*.example.org sorry,no,entrance * 0 -1



     The hostname or IP to match (CIDR allowed), kill line comment or
     (very rarely used) time interval when kill line is effective, user-
     name or auth to match, port on which kill line is effective. Lower-
     case ``k'' matches on auth, read the INSTALL file for more info.

     The same as for ``stats K'' with one exception: field last but one
     shows time to live of a temporary kill line (and it always matches
     on all ports).

     1st field is client info (client can be server, too). If uppercase
     ``L'' is used, then the real IP is shown, not the hostname.  2nd
     field is sendQ, 3rd received lines, 4th received bytes, 5th sent
     lines, 6th sent bytes, 7th is client uptime.

     This command accepts second parameter: if present, it shows the
