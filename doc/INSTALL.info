1.1 The configure script
========================

This package uses a GNU configure script for its configuration.  You
simply need to untar the distribution and run the "configure" script.
This will run configure which will probe your system for any
peculiarities it has and setup the Makefile and a file of default
#define's ($arch/setup.h).

   There are a few options to "configure" to help it out, or change the
default behaviour:

`--prefix=DIR'
     changes the default directory into which ircd will install using
     "make install".  This defaults to /usr/local

`--sbindir=DIR'
     changes the default directory where the system admin executable
     files will go. It is important to set this properly. (default is
     prefix/sbin)

`--sysconfdir=DIR'
     changes the default directory where the irc server configuration
     files will go. (default is prefix/etc)

`--localstatedir=DIR'
     changes the default directory where the irc server state files
     will go. (default is prefix/var)

`--with-logdir=DIR'
     changes the default directory where the irc log files will go.
     (default is localstatedir/log)

`--with-resconf=FILE'
     defines the file to be used by ircd to initialize its resolver.
     (default is /etc/resolv.conf)

`--zlib-include=DIR'
     specifies in which directory the include file from the zlib is
     located.

`--zlib-library=DIR'
     specifies in which directory the zlib library is located.

`--zlib-prefix=DIR'
     specifies the prefix for zlib location.  It overrides the 2
     previous options.  (The include directory is supposed to be in
     prefix/include, and the library in prefix/lib).

`--with-zlib'
     is the default.  "configure" looks on your system to find the
     zlib.  If found, ircd will be linked using it.  This does NOT mean
     you can use server link compression, for this you also need to
     define ZIP_LINKS (see section below).

`--without-zlib'
     tells "configure" not to look for the zlib.  Defining this will
     keep you from using server link compression.

`--enable-dsm'
     Enable Dynamically Shared Modules support for iauth

1.2 Notes for Cygwin32 users
============================

The daemon of 2.11 release compiles properly on W32 systems which have
the GNU-Win32 environment (`http://www.cygwin.com/') setup.  At the
time of the release, tests were made using the version b20.1 of the
Cygwin32 library.

   When compiling on such system, you want to make sure that you have
carefully followed the Cygwin32 installation notes.

   Also, the IRC server needs a *resolv.conf* file in order to
initialize the resolver.  This file can be anywhere (see configure
options), and is typically in */etc* on UNIX systems.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Notes concerning IPv6 support,  Prev: Notes for Cygwin32 users,  Up: Installing IRC-

1.3 Notes concerning IPv6 support
=================================

This version was tested on the following IPv6 systems: BSD/OS+KAME,
Digital Unix, FreeBSD+KAME, Linux, NetBSD+INRIA.

   Because IPv6 numeric addresses contain ":" characters, *the default
separator for the server configuration file is changed to "%"*. You can
adjust it to your needs in config.h file.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: The config-h file,  Next: Editing the Makefile and compiling,  Prev: Installing IRC-,  Up: Top

2 The config-h file
*******************

The second step consists of defining options before the compilation.
This is done by editing the "config.h" file and changing the various
#DEFINE's.

* Menu:

* DEBUGMODE::
* CHROOTDIR::
* USERS_RFC1459 USERS_SHOWS_UTMP::
* ENABLE_SUMMON::
* DEFAULT_INVISIBLE::
* OPER_KILL OPER_CONNECT OPER_DIE OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART OPER_SET---::
* ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL::
* SLOW_ACCEPT::
* CLONE_CHECK::
* LOG_SERVER_CHANNELS::
* Other #define's::


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: DEBUGMODE,  Next: CHROOTDIR,  Up: The config-h file

2.1 DEBUGMODE
=============

*This should only be defined for test purposes, and never used on a
production server.*

   Define DEBUGMODE if you want to see the ircd debugging information
as the daemon is running. Normally this function will be undefined as
ircd produces a considerable amount of output.  DEBUGMODE must be
defined for either of -t or -x command line options to work.  Defining
this induces a large overhead for the server as it does a large amount
of self diagnostics whilst running.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: CHROOTDIR,  Next: USERS_RFC1459 USERS_SHOWS_UTMP,  Prev: DEBUGMODE,  Up: The config-h file

2.2 CHROOTDIR
=============

To use the CHROOTDIR feature, make sure it is #define'd and that the
server is being run as root. Better use some other (external) way of
setting up chroot environment for ircd and run it from there, not
requiring to run as root.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: USERS_RFC1459 USERS_SHOWS_UTMP,  Next: ENABLE_SUMMON,  Prev: CHROOTDIR,  Up: The config-h file

2.3 USERS_RFC1459 USERS_SHOWS_UTMP
==================================

Leaving USERS_RFC1459 undefined makes ircd return RPL_LOCALUSERS and
RPL_GLOBALUSERS numerics (part of NAMES). Defining USERS_RFC1459 makes
USERS command to behave like it is defined in RFC. If defined, security
conscious server admins may still wish to leave USERS_SHOWS_UTMP
undefined, effectively disabling the USERS command which can be used to
glean information the same as finger can.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: ENABLE_SUMMON,  Next: DEFAULT_INVISIBLE,  Prev: USERS_RFC1459 USERS_SHOWS_UTMP,  Up: The config-h file

2.4 ENABLE_SUMMON
=================

ENABLE_SUMMON toggles whether the server will attempt to summon local
users to irc by writing a message similar to that from talk(1) to a
user's tty.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: DEFAULT_INVISIBLE,  Next: OPER_KILL OPER_CONNECT OPER_DIE OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART OPER_SET---,  Prev: ENABLE_SUMMON,  Up: The config-h file

2.5 DEFAULT_INVISIBLE
=====================

The DEFAULT_INVISIBLE define is used to toggle whether clients are
automatically made invisible when they register.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: OPER_KILL OPER_CONNECT OPER_DIE OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART OPER_SET---,  Next: ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL,  Prev: DEFAULT_INVISIBLE,  Up: The config-h file

2.6 OPER_KILL OPER_CONNECT OPER_DIE OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART OPER_SET--
=======================================================================

Any operator priviledge can be precisely applied to a given user using
O:line flags. Some admins may prefer to feel more safe by undefining
some of above thus disabling access to corresponding command at all.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL,  Next: SLOW_ACCEPT,  Prev: OPER_KILL OPER_CONNECT OPER_DIE OPER_REHASH OPER_RESTART OPER_SET---,  Up: The config-h file

2.7 ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL
=======================

As of the 2.9.3 version of the server, server-server connections may be
compressed using the zlib.  In order to compile the server with this
feature, you MUST have the zlib package (version 1.0 or higher) already
compiled and define ZIP_LINKS in the config.h file. Compression use for
server-server connections is separately configured in the ircd.conf
file for each server-server link.  ZIP_LEVEL allows you to control the
compression level that will be used.  Values above 5 will noticeably
increase the CPU used by the server.

   The zlib package may be found at `http://www.gzip.org/zlib/'. The
data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for
Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
`ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt' (zlib format), rfc1951.txt
(deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: SLOW_ACCEPT,  Next: CLONE_CHECK,  Prev: ZIP_LINKS ZIP_LEVEL,  Up: The config-h file

2.8 SLOW_ACCEPT
===============

This option is undefined by default, however is needed on some OSes.
It creates an artificial delay in processing incoming connections.  On
a given port, no more than 1 connection per 2 seconds will be processed.

   As it is undefined, it lets the server process connections as fast
as it can which can cause problems on some OSes (such as SunOS) and be
abused (fast massive join of clonebots..), for these reasons, if you
decide to keep SLOW_ACCEPT undefined you MUST define CLONE_CHECK.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: CLONE_CHECK,  Next: LOG_SERVER_CHANNELS,  Prev: SLOW_ACCEPT,  Up: The config-h file

2.9 CLONE_CHECK
===============

This option is defined by default and acts as a wrapper, by checking
incoming connections early before starting ident query.  By default,
the server will not accept more than 10 connections from the same host
within 2 seconds.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: LOG_SERVER_CHANNELS,  Next: Other #define's,  Prev: CLONE_CHECK,  Up: The config-h file

2.10 LOG_SERVER_CHANNELS
========================

This option allows you to log to files server channels (like &NOTICES)
chosen via LOG_SCH_* defines. Very handy.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Other #define's,  Prev: LOG_SERVER_CHANNELS,  Up: The config-h file

2.11 Other #define's
====================

The rest of the user changable #define's should be pretty much self
explanatory in the config.h file.  It is *NOT* recommended that any of
the file under the line with "STOP STOP" in it be changed.


File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Editing the Makefile and compiling,  Next: The ircd-conf file,  Prev: The config-h file,  Up: Top

3 Editing the Makefile and compiling
************************************

This package now uses GNU autoconf to probe your system and generate
the correct Makefile.  However you may need to read it to check for
values generated by the configure script.  In particular, all the
filenames, and path for binaries, log files, configuration files and so
on are defined there.  It is recommended to make use of the options
described in the "configure script" section rather than to edit the
generated Makefile.  However, these options do not provide a total
control over these values, in which case you need to directly edit the
Makefile.

   Now to build the package, type "make all".  If everything goes will,
you can then install it by typing "make install".

   If you have trouble compiling ircd, copy Makefile.in to Makefile and
edit Makefile as appropriate.

   If everything went fine, the default layout of installed files is as
follows (note that existing iauth.conf and ircd.motd will not be
overwritten): PREFIX/sbin/ircd PREFIX/sbin/iauth PREFIX/sbin/chkconf
PREFIX/sbin/ircd-mkpasswd PREFIX/sbin/ircdwatch PREFIX/man/man8/ircd.8
PREFIX/man/man8/iauth.8 PREFIX/man/man8/ircdwatch.8
PREFIX/man/man5/iauth.conf.5 PREFIX/etc/ircd.m4
PREFIX/etc/ircd.conf.example PREFIX/etc/iauth.conf.example
PREFIX/etc/iauth.conf PREFIX/etc/ircd.motd PREFIX/var/run/
PREFIX/var/log/ Files created by ircd package during normal execution
would be ircd.pid, ircd.tune, iauth.pid, ircdwatch.pid in
PREFIX/var/run/ and ircd.users, ircd.rejects, ircd.auth, ircd.opers,
ircd.debug, iauth.debug in PREFIX/var/log/.

4 The ircd-conf file
********************

After installing the ircd and irc programs, edit the ircd.conf file as
per the instructions in this section and install it in the location you
specified in the config.h file.  There is a sample conf file called
ircd.conf.example in the doc/ directory.

   Appendix A (See INSTALL.appendix) describes the differences between
IP addresses and host names.  If you are unfamiliar with this, you
should probably scan through it before proceeding.

   The ircd.conf file contains various records that specify
configuration options.  The record types are as follows:

  1. Machine information   (M)

  2. Administrative info   (A)

  3. Port connections      (P)

  4. Connection Classes    (Y)

  5. Client connections    (I,i)

  6. Operator privileges   (O,o)

  7. Excluded accounts     (K,k)

  8. X Excluded accounts   (X)

  9. Server connections    (C,c,N)

 10. Deny auto-connections (D)

 11. Hub connections       (H)

 12. Leaf connections      (L)

 13. Version limitations   (V)

 14. Excluded machines     (Q)

 15. Service connections   (S)

 16. Bounce server         (B)

   Except for types "M" and "A", you are allowed to have multiple
records of the same type.  In some cases, you can have concurrent
records.  *It is important to note that the last matching record will
be used*.  This is especially useful when setting up I records (client
connections).

`NEW!!!'
     As of the 2.11.0 version of the server, if the server has been
     compiled with #define CONFIG_DIRECTIVE_INCLUDE, you will be able
     to use #include directive in ircd.conf to include files without
     the need of M4, also recursively.  #include "filename" For the
     command to be recognized, `#' MUST be first character in the line
     and there must be space after "include" word. Quotes around
     filename are optional.  If filename does not start with slash,
     ircd config directory is prepended.  Also note that chkconf will
     follow such includes.

4.1 Machine information
=======================

`Introduction'
     IRC needs to know a few things about your UNIX site, and the "M"
     command specifies this information for IRC.  The fomat of this
     command is:

`Format'
     M:<Server NAME>:<YOUR Internet IP#>:<Geographic
     Location>:<Port>:<SID>:

`M'
     "M" specifies a Machine description line

`Server NAME'
     The name of YOUR server adding any Internet DOMAINNAME that might
     also be present. If this hostname can be resolved, the IP# found
     will be used to for outgoing connections.  Otherwise the default
     interface address of the host is used.  The server name may not be
     FQDN of another host.  (This means all outgoing connections will
     be done from the same IP#, even if your host has several IP#).

`YOUR Internet IP#'
     If the machine on which you run the server has several IP
     addresses, you can define which IP# to use for outgoing
     connections.  This overrides overrides the "Server NAME".

     See Also the "Port Connections" and "Server Connections" sections.

`Geographic Location'
     Geographic Location is used to say where your server is, and gives
     people in other parts of the world a good idea of where you are!
     If your server is in the USA, it is usually best to say: <CITY>
     <STATE>, USA.  Like for Denver I say: "Denver Colorado, USA".
     Finnish sites (like tolsun.oulu.fi generally say something like
     "Oulu, Finland".

`Port'
     Defines the port on which your server will listen for UDP pings
     from other servers.  This should be the port were other servers
     are set to autoconnect.  (Also see the port field description in
     connect lines).

`SID'
     Defines Server ID, network-wide unique identifier of your server.
     It must begin with a digit. This must be set with cooperation of
     other servers' admins. On IRCnet you must consult your coord
     and/or admins of your peers.

`Example:'
     M:tolsun.oulu.fi::Oulu, Finland:6667:00PA:

     This line reads: My Host's name is "tolsun.oulu.fi", my site is
     located in "Oulu, Finland" and my SID is "00PA".

     M:orion.cair.du.edu::Denver Colorado, USA:6667:00PS:

     This line reads: My Hosts name is "orion.cair.du.edu", my site is
     located in "Denver Colorado, USA" and my SID is "00PS".

`Note'
     Using "*" as <Your Internet IP> allows OS to choose best outgoing
     source IP. See also *Server Connections* section for configuring
     source IP of outgoing connections.



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Administrative info,  Next: Port connections,  Prev: Machine information,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.2 Administrative info
=======================

`Introduction'
     The "A" line is used for administrative information about a site.
     The e-mail address of the person running the server should be
     included here in case problems arise.

`Format'
     A:<Your Name/Location>:<Your E-Mail Addr>:<other>::<network name>:

`A'
     This specifies an Admin record.

`Your Name & Location'
     Use this field to say tell your FULL NAME and where in the world
     your machine is.  Be sure to add your City, State/Province and
     Country.

`Your Electronix Mailing Addr'
     Use this field to specify your Electronic Mailing Address
     preferably your Internet Mailing Address.  If you have a UUCP or
     ARAPnet address - please add that as well.  Be sure to add any
     extra DOMAIN information that is needed, for example "mail
     jtrim@orion" probably won't work as a mail address to me if you
     happen to be in Alaska.  But "mail jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu" would
     work because you know that "orion" is part of the DOMAIN
     "cair.du.edu".  So be sure to add your DOMAINNAMES to your mailing
     addresses.

`Other'
     This is really an OTHER field - you can add what you want here.

`Network name'
     Use this field to announce your network name in 005 numerics. Use
     only one word!

`Example'
     [the line is just one line in the confuration file, here it is cut
     into two lines to make it clearer to read]:

     A:Jeff Trim -  Denver Colorado, USA:INET jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu
     UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim:Terve! Heippa!  Have you said hello
     in Finnish today?;)::IRCnet:

     Would look like this when printed out with the /admin command:

     Jeff Trim -  Denver Colorado, USA INET jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu
     UUCP {hao,isis}!udenva!jtrim Terve! Hei! Heippa!  Have you said
     hello in Finnish today? ;)

     Note that the A record cannot be split across multiple lines; it
     will typically be longer than 80 characters and will therefore
     wrap around the screen.



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Port connections,  Next: Connection Classes,  Prev: Administrative info,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.3 Port connections
====================

`Introduction'
     The port line adds flexibility to the server's ability to accept
     connections. By use of this line in the ircd.conf file, it is easy
     to setup both Unix Domain ports for the server to accept
     connections on as well as extra internet ports.

`Format'
     P:<Internet IP#>:::<Port>::<Flags>:
     P:<Directory>:::<Port>::<Flags>:


   * Internet Ports

    `Internet IP#'
          If the host on which the server runs has several IP
          addresses, you can define for which IP address connections
          will be accepted. If none is defined here, server will bind
          to all interfaces (INADDR_ANY).  See also *Machine
          configuration* and *Server Connections* sections to properly
          configure outgoing connections.

    `Port'
          The port number field tells the server which port number it
          should listen on for incoming connections.

    `Example'
          P:192.168.1.194:::6664:

          Listens for incoming connections on IP 192.168.1.194, port
          6664.


   *  Unix Socket Ports.

    `Directory'
          The path set in this field should be the directory name in
          which to create the unix socket for later listening to. The
          server will attempt to create the directory before creating
          the unix socket.

    `Port'
          The port field when used in combination with a pathname in a
          P-line is the filename created in the directory set in the
          first field.

    `Example'
          P:/tmp/.ircd:::6667:

          Creates a unix socket in the /tmp/.ircd directory called
          "6667". The unix socket (file) must be a numerical.


`Flags'
     Flags changing behaviour of a given P-line. It can be empty or one
     of:

        * D - delayed accept (not active until first netjoin)

        * S - server-only (user connections are rejected)

     Using 'D' flag is a nice way to help network not get invaded after
     restart. It does not enable listening socket on a given port
     before server has a chance to join a network. Note that you can
     change state of the listening sockets using SET CACCEPT oper
     command. Current state of sockets can be seen with STATS P (case
     sensitive).

`Note'
     You need at least one P-line or server won't start.  (Unless you
     run it from inetd.)



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Connection Classes,  Next: Client connections,  Prev: Port connections,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.4 Connection Classes
======================

`Introduction'
     To enable more efficient use of MAXIMUM_LINKS, connection classes
     were implemented.  All clients belong to a connection class.

     Each line for a server should have the same number as the sixth
     field.  If it is absent, the server deaults it to 0, using the
     defaults from the config.h file.

     To define a connection class, you need to include a Y: line in the
     ircd.conf file.  This enables you to define the ping frequency,
     connection frequency (for servers) and maximum number of links
     that class should have.

     Currently, the Y: line *MUST* appear in the ircd.conf file
     *BEFORE* it is used in any other way.

`Format'
     Y:<Class>:<Ping Freq>:<Connect Freq>:<Max Links>:<SendQ>:<Local
     Limit>:<Global Limit>:<CIDR Limit>

`Y'
     This specifies a Class record.

`Class'
     This is the class number which gains the following attributes and
     should match that which is on the end of the C/c/N/I/O/S line.

`Ping Frequency'
     This field defines how long the server will let the connection
     remain "silent" before sending a PING message to make sure it is
     still alive.  Unless you are sure of what you are doing, use the
     default value which is in your config.h file.

`Connect Frequency'
     By changing this number, you change how often your server checks
     to see if it can connect to this server. If you want to check very
     occasionally, use a large value, but if it is an important
     connection, you might want a smaller value so that you autoconnect
     to it as soon as possible.

`Max Links'
     This field defines the maximum number of links this class will
     allow from automatic connections (C lines).  Using /CONNECT
     overrides this feature.  Also defines the maximum number of users
     in this class for all I/O lines being in that class (or per I/O
     line, if defined).

`SendQ'
     This field defines the "SendQ" (data awaiting to be sent to the
     client) value for this class. The format is <x>.<y>

        *  x: defines maximum size of sendq, defaults to QUEUELEN if
          unset.

        *  y: defines maximum size of sendq during burst, defaults to x
          if unset.

`Local limit'
     This field is used to limit the number of local concurrent
     connections.  The format is <x>.<y>

        *  x: defines the maximum number of clients from the same host
          (IP) will be allowed.

        *  y: defines the maximum number of clients from the same
          user@host (IP) will be allowed.  Read note below.

     Any unset value defaults to 1 (one).

`Global limit'
     This field has the same use as the "Local limit" field.  But, the
     connection counts are done for all clients present on the net
     instead of only counting local clients.

`CIDR Limit'
     This field is used to limit the number of local host counts within
     a given IP network. The format is <x>/<y>

        *  x: defines the maximum number of clients from the same
          network

        *  y: defines the length of the network in CIDR format

`Note'
     leaving any of the fields (except SendQ and limits) out means
     their value is 0 (ZERO)!!  The SendQ field default value is
     dynamically determined. Limits default to 1.1 (one connection)
     except CIDR limit, which doesn't apply at all if left empty.

`Note'
     If you plan to use the local user@host limit, please read the
     following very carefully.  The "user" value is the ident reply for
     the connection.  If no reply was given then it defaults to
     "unknown" and thus the effective limit will be per host, not per
     user@host. Also, some ident servers return encrypted data which
     changes for every connection making the limit void. If you think
     limits do not work, check ircd logs, the auth reply can be longer
     than what ircd shows on-line.

`Note'
     Only the local limitation is accurate.

`Note'
     If you define a gobal limit, you should also define a local limit
     (same or lower) as it won't take more CPU and will make the global
     limit more accurate.

`Note'
     The local and global limits only affect users (I lines), not
     servers nor services.

`Example'
     Y:23:120:300:5:800000:0:0: (server class)

     This defines class 23 to allow 5 auto-connections, which are
     checked every 300 seconds.  The connection is allowed to remain
     silent for 120 seconds before a PING is sent.  NOTE: fields 3 & 4
     are in seconds.  The SendQ is set to 800000 bytes.

     Y:1:60:0:50:20000:2:5: (client class)

     In case of a client class, the fields are interpreted a bit
     differently.  This class (number 1) can be used by up to 50 users.
     The connections are allowed to remain silent for 60 seconds before
     a PING is set.  The SendQ is set to 20000 bytes.  A new connection
     in this class will only be allowed if there aren't more than 2
     other local connections from the same IP address, or more than 5
     other connections on the net from the same hostname.

`Note'
     The default maxlinks behaviour has changed in 2.11.2, see config.h
     for details.

     Y:2:60:0:50:20000:2.1:5: (client class)

     In case of a client class, the fields are interpreted a bit
     differently.  This class (number 2) can be used by up to 50 users.
     The connections are allowed to remain silent for 60 seconds before
     a PING is set.  The SendQ is set to 20000 bytes.  A new connection
     in this class will only be allowed if there aren't more than 2
     other local connections from the same IP address, 1 local
     connection from the same user from the same IP address, or more
     than 5 other connections on the net from the same hostname.

     Y:2:60:0:50:20000:2.1:5:4/24 (client class)

     Other numbers are exactly the same as previous. Last field limits
     connections within the same /24 to 4 hosts. It does not matter how
     many different /24 networks are using this Y:line, each will have
     separate count.

4.5 Client connections
======================

How to let clients connect to your IRCD.

`Introduction'
     A client is a program that connects to the ircd daemon (ircd).
     There are clients written in C, GNU Emacs Lisp and many other
     languages.  The "irc" program is the C client.  Each person that
     talks via IRC is running their own client.

     The ircd.conf files contains entries that specify which clients
     are allowed to connect to your irc daemon.  Obviously you want to
     allow your own machine's clients to connect.  You may want to
     allow clients from other sites to connect.  These remote clients
     will use your server as a connection point.  All messages sent by
     these clients will pass through your machine.

`Format'
     I:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Hosts
     NAME>:<Port>:<Class>:<Flags>

`Note'
     Lower case "i" is equal to an "R" flag in plain "I".  Lower case
     "i" will be removed in the next version.

`TARGET Host Addr'
     Specifies the IP address(es) of the machine(s) that are allowed to
     connect.  If "user@" prefixes the actual IP address the server
     will require that the remote username returned by the ident server
     be the same as the one given before the "@".  Wildcards are
     permitted unless using a bitmask (e.g. 1.2.3.0/24). Note that
     bitmask are encouraged over wildcards, as they are more accurate.

     Empty field is equal to '*' (matches any).

`Password'
     The password that must be given by the client to be allowed on the
     server.

`TARGET Host NAME'
     Specifies the host name(s) of the machines allowed to connect to
     the server.  If "user@" prefixes the actual name the server will
     require that the remote username returned by the ident server be
     the same as the one given before the "@".  Wildcards are permitted,
     but *please* rather leave this field empty and use bitmask in
     *Host Addr* field.

     Empty field matches any. "*" also matches any, but it requires
     working DNS for a client.

     Using this field to enforce that clients have no Host Name set is
     not working (they will rather be denied connection). Use "N"
     *flag*.

`Port'
     Specifies the port number for which this configuration line is
     valid.  An empty field, or "0" matches all ports.

`Class'
     This field should refer to an existing class.  Connections classes
     are usefull to limit the number of users allowed on the server.

`Flags'
     This field contains flags of an I:line; flags are one character in
     size, can be combined and their order does not matter.

        * D - restricted, when client has no reverse DNS

        * E - client is exempted from K-lines

        * e - client is exempted from X-lines

        * F - fall-through to next I-line if password did not match

        * I - restricted, when client has no ident.

        * M - disable resolved host name to be shown

        * N - disable resolved host name to be used

        * R - restricted

`Note'
     Restricted I: line means that clients matching such I line will
     not be able to use their operator privileges (no nick/mode change,
     no kick). Such users will also have their username prefixed by +,
     = or - depending on the ident reply.

`Note'
     The server checks if the client hostname matches the *TARGET Host
     NAME* field.  If a match is found, server checks *TARGET Host
     Addr* field.  If a match is found, the client is accepted. Clients
     host is set either to its hostname (if available) or, using "N" or
     "M" flag, to its IP.

`Note'
     The difference between "M" and "N" flags is simple: after host
     resolving and I:line matching is done, "M" keeps hostname and uses
     it for matching in beIR modes and printing in logs, while "N"
     discards it completely.

`Examples'
     For example, if you were installing IRC on tolsun.oulu.fi and you
     wanted to let your own clients to connect to your server, you
     would add this entry to the file:

     I:::tolsun.oulu.fi::1

     If you wanted to let remote clients connect, you could add the
     following line:

     I:::*.edu.edu::1

     and allow any clients from machines whose names end in ".edu.edu"
     to connect with no password.

     I:128.214.6.100::nic.funet.fi::1

     Allow clients from a machine with that IP number *and* that
     hostname to connect.

     I::secret:*.tut.fi::1

     Allow clients from machines matching "*.tut.fi" to connect with
     the password "secret".

     I:::*::1

     Allow anyone from anywhere to connect to your server.

     I:::*.fi:6667:1

     Allow clients from machines matching "*.fi" to connect on the port
     6667.

     I:135.11.35.0/24::*.net::1

     Allows clients from machines which host name matches "*.net" *and*
     which IP address is within block "135.11.35.0/24" to connect to
     the server.

     I:135.11.35.0/24::::1:N

     I:135.11.35.0/24::*.net::1

     This set of two I:lines allows clients from machines which host
     name matches "*.net" *and* which IP address is within block
     "135.11.35.0/24" to connect to the server.  If the host name does
     not match "*.net" then another I:line is used and because of "N"
     flag, the IP address is used for these clients, even if the host
     name is known.

     I:135.11.35.0/24::::1

     Allows clients from machines which IP address is within block
     "135.11.35.0/24" to connect to the server.  If the host name is
     known, is it used as address for these clients.

`NEW!!!'
     As of the 2.11.0 version of the server, I: line flags are
     introduced.

4.6 Operator priviliges
=======================

How to become the IRC administrator on your site

`Introduction'
     To become an IRC Administrator, IRC must know who is authorized to
     become an operator and what their "Nickname" and "Password" is.

`Format'
     O:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Password>:<Nickname>:<Port>:<Class>:<Flags>

`O'
     Specifies Operator record.

`Note'
     If you use small letter ("o") in it, it specifies a local
     operator. This is deprecated behaviour, use O:line flags.
     Operator rights can be specified in config.h and fine-tuned in
     ircd.conf.

`TARGET Host NAME'
     Tells IRC which host you have the privileges FROM.  This means
     that you should be logged into this host when you ask for the
     priviliges.  If you specify "tolsun.oulu.fi" then IRC will expect
     your CLIENT to be connected at "tolsun.oulu.fi" - when you ask for
     OPERATOR privileges from "tolsun.oulu.fi".  You cannot be logged in
     at any other host and be able to use your OPERATOR privileges at
     tolsun, only when you are connected at TOLSUN will this work -
     this is a safeguard against unauthorized sites.

`Password'
     If your AUTHORIZATION Password - this is the password that let's
     IRC know you are who you say you are!  Never tell anyone your
     password and always keep the "ircd.conf" file protected from all
     of the other users.

`Nickname'
     The Nickname you usually go by - but you can make this what you
     want.

`Port'
     Unused.

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class (preferably
     having a lower number than that for the relevant I-line) and
     determines the maximum number of simultaneous uses of the O-line
     allowable through the max. links field in the Y-line.

`Flags'
     This field contains flags of an O:line; flags are one character in
     size, can be combined and their order does not matter.  They
     define privileges of an operator.

        * L - local operator (disables all remote functions)

        * P - removes penalty

        * p - allows flooding

        * & - allows joining &CLIENTS

        * A - enables all flags below

        * C - allows local and remote CONNECT

        * c - allows local CONNECT

        * D - allows DIE

        * d - allows DNS

        * e - allows SET

        * h - allows HAZH

        * K - allows local and remote KILL

        * k - allows local KILL

        * l - allows CLOSE

        * R - allows RESTART

        * r - allows REHASH

        * S - allows local and remote SQUIT

        * s - allows local SQUIT

        * T - allows TKLINE

        * q - allows KLINE

        * t - enables full TRACE and STATS L

        * v - allows SIDTRACE

     "L" flag cannot be overridden by other flags.  If <Flags> field is
     left empty, no privileges will be granted.

`Example'
     O:orion.cair.du.edu:pyunxc:Jeff::1:A

     There is an OPERATOR at "orion.cair.du.edu" that can get Operator
     priviliges if he specifies a password of "pyunxc" and uses a
     NICKNAME of "Jeff" and is granted all possible privileges.

`Note'
     Host NAME accepts IP bitmasks.

`Note'
     Some privileges may be disabled during compilation time in
     config.h.

4.7 Excluded accounts
=====================

Remove an errant user from IRC on your site.

`Introduction'
     Obviously it is hoped that you wouldn't have to use this command.
     Unfortunately sometimes a user can become unmanageable and this is
     your only recourse - the KILL USER command.  THIS COMMAND ONLY
     AFFECTS YOUR SERVER - if this user can connect to another server
     somewhere else in the IRC network then you would have to talk to
     the administrator on that site to disable his access from that
     IRCD server as well.

`Format'
     K:<Host Name>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<User>:<port>: k:<Host
     Name>:<time interval(s)|comment>:<Auth>:<port>:

`K'
     "K" tells the IRCD that you are making a KILL USER command entry.

`Host Name'
     In this field you specify the Hostname or the IP address (Single
     IP, Wildcard notation or bitmask notation) that the user is
     connecting from.  If you wanted to REMOVE connects to IRC from
     "orion.cair.du.edu" then you would want to enter
     "orion.cair.du.edu".  If you want to REMOVE ALL HOSTS access you
     can use "*" (Wild Card notation) and no matter what host the
     USERNAME (specified in Field 4) connects from s/he will be denied
     access.

     If you specify an IP address, IP mask, or an IP bitmask, it will
     match clients connecting from the matching addresses, no matter if
     they resolve or not.

     You can prefix an IP address, an IP mask, or IP bitmask by "=" in
     which case only non resolving matching hosts will be banned.

`time interval(s)|comment'
     Either leave this field empty or put a comment, then the line
     active continuously for the specified user/host machine.  You may
     also specify intervals during the line should be active, see
     examples below.

`User'
     The USERNAME of the user you want removed from IRC.  For example
     "root".

`Auth'
     If the user's ident server replies with the OTHER type (as opposed
     to the UNIX type), the reply is not used to set the user's
     username.  (lowercase) k lines can be used in these case to reject
     users based on their ident reply.

     This field will be matched against the ident server reply.  It is
     important to note that OTHER replies are prefixed with a "-" by
     the ircd, while UNIX replies are not.

`Port'
     The port on which the Kill line will be effective. 0 means all
     ports.

`Examples'
     K:orion.cair.du.edu::jtrim:0:

     If user "jtrim" connects to IRC from host "orion.cair.du.edu" then
     IMMEDIATELY REMOVE HIM from my IRCD.

     k:*.stealth.net::-43589:0:

     If a user connects from any host that has the suffix "stealth.net"
     and if that host ident server returns "-43589" - then IMMEDIATELY
     REMOVE THEM from my IRCD.

     K:*.cair.du.edu::root:0:

     If user "root" connects to IRC from any host that has the suffix
     "cair.du.edu" - then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THEM from my IRCD.

     K:*::vijay:0:

     This line reads "I don't care WHAT HOST user "vijay" is on, I will
     NEVER allow username "vijay" to login to my IRCD."

     K:*.oulu.fi:0800-1200,1400-1900:*:0:

     This disallows all users from hosts with enddomain "oulu.fi"
     access to your server between 8 and 12am, 2 and 7pm. Users get
     kicked off if they're already signed on when the line becomes
     active (they'll get a warning 5 minutes before). Note that this
     requires ircd to be compiled with proper #define!

     K:192.11.35.0/24::*:0:

     This line disallows all hosts whose IP address is from network
     "192.11.35.0/24" to login to the ircd.

     K:=192.11.35.0/24::*:0:

     This line disallows all hosts whose IP address is from network
     "192.11.35.0/24" and which didn't resolve to login to the ircd.

=======================

Remove an errant user from IRC on your site.

`Introduction'
     Obviously it is hoped that you wouldn't have to use this command.
     Unfortunately sometimes a virus can become difficult to remove by
     other means and this is your only recourse - the XKILL USER
     command.  THIS COMMAND ONLY AFFECTS YOUR SERVER - if this user can
     connect to another server somewhere else in the IRC network then
     you would have to talk to the administrator on that site to
     disable his access from that IRCD server as well.

`Format'
     X:<USER 1st arg>:<USER 2nd arg>:<USER 3rd arg>:<USER 4th
     arg>:<Nick>:<Target host addr>

`X'
     "X" tells the IRCD that you are making an XKILL USER command entry.

`USER n-th arg'
     Given field will be matched against corresponding parameter of
     client USER command.  If left empty it matches any.  It may
     contain wildcards.

`Nick'
     If left empty it matches any.  It may contain wildcards.

`Target host addr'
     Host or IP address or Network in CIDR format. It makes given
     X:line apply only to a selected hosts. May contain wildcards.  If
     left empty it matches any.

`Examples'
     X:guest:::guest: If user registers with the following USER command
     USER guest anything anything :guest then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE HIM
     from my IRCD.  X:abc:::def:woof: If user registers with the
     following NICK and USER commands NICK woof USER abc anything
     anything :def then IMMEDIATELY REMOVE HIM from my IRCD.

`Note'
     You need to compile server with #define XLINE to get this
     functionality.

4.9 Server connections
======================

How to connect to other servers, How other servers can connect to you

   *WARNING:* The hostnames used as examples are really only examples
and not meant to be used (simply because they don't work) in real life.

   Now you must decide WHICH hosts you want to connect to and WHAT
ORDER you want to connect to them in.  For my example let us assume I
am on the machine "rieska.oulu.fi" and I want to connect to irc daemons
on 3 other machines:

   * "garfield.mit.edu"        - Tertiary Connection

   * "irc.nada.kth.se"         - Secondary Connection

   * "nic.funet.fi"            - Primary Connection

   And I prefer to connect to them in that order, meaning I first want
to try connecting to "nic.funet.fi", then to "irc.nada.kth.edu", and
finally to "garfield.mit.edu".  So if "nic.funet.fi" is down or
unreachable, the program will try to connect to "irc.nada.kth.se". If
irc.nada.kth.se is down it will try to connect to garfield and so forth.

   PLEASE limit the number of hosts you will attempt to connect to down
to 3. This is because of two main reasons:

  1.  to save your server from causing extra load and delays to users

  2.  to save internet from extra network traffic (remember the old
     rwho program with traffic problems when the number of machines
     increased).

`Format'
     C:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<TARGET
     PORT>:<Class>:<Source IP>

     for example:

     C:nic.funet.fi:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     - or -

     C:128.214.6.100:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

     - or -

     C:root@nic.funet.fi:passwd:nic.funet.fi:6667:1

`C'
     This field tells the IRC program which option is being configured.
     "C" corresponds to a server Connect option.

`TARGET Host Addr'
     Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
     to.  If "user@" prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the
     server will require that the remote username returned by the ident
     server be the same as the one given before the "@".

`Password'
     The password of the other host.  A password must always be present
     for the line to be recognized.

`TARGET Host NAME'
     This is the name that the TARGET server will identify itself with
     when you connect to it.  If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi
     you would receive "nic.funet.fi" and that is what you should place
     in this field.

`TARGET PORT'
     The INTERNET Port that you want to connect to on the TARGET
     machine. Most of the time this will be set to "6667".  If this
     field is left blank, then no connections will be attempted to the
     TARGET host, and your host will accept connections FROM the TARGET
     host instead.  The port field can contain 2 ports, separated by a
     . In this case, the first port is used when auto-connecting, the
     second port is used for the UDP pings to the targer server.  It
     can be negative to disable autoconnects, absolute value will be
     used to connect when CONNECT command with port "0" is used.

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class and determines
     the maximum number of simultaneous uses of the C-line allowable
     through the max. links field in the Y-line.

`Source IP'
     This field specifies source IP to use for connects to this server.

`Compressed links'
     Server connections can be compressed with the zlib library.  To
     define a compressed connection, you must have compiled the server
     with ZIP_LINKS defined, and use a _lowercase_ C line.

`NEW!!!'
     As of the 2.11.0 version of the server, *Source IP* field has been
     added.


   Some examples:

   * C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1 This reads: Connect to host
     "nic.funet.fi", with no password and expect this server to
     identify itself to you as "nic.funet.fi". Your machine will
     connect to this host to port 6667.

   * C:18.72.0.252:Jeff:garfield.mit.edu:6667:1:192.168.0.18 This
     reads: Connect to a host at address "18.72.0.252", using a
     password of "Jeff".  The TARGET server should identify itself as
     "garfield.mit.edu".  You will connect to Internet Port 6667 on
     this host. This connection will use (your) source IP of
     "192.168.0.18".

   * C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:1 This reads: do not attempt to
     autoconnect to "irc.nada.kth.se", but if "irc.nada.kth.se"
     requests a connection, allow it to connect.


   Now back to our original problem, we wanted OUR server CONNECT to 3
hosts,  "nic.funet.fi", "irc.nada.kth.se" and "garfield.mit.edu" in
that order.  So as we enter these entries into the file they must be
done in *reverse* order of how we could want to connect to them.

   Here's how it would look if we connected "nic.funet.fi" first:

   C:garfield.mit.edu::garfield.mit.edu:6667:1
C:irc.nada.kth.se::irc.nada.kth.se:6667:1
C:nic.funet.fi::nic.funet.fi:6667:1

   Ircd will attempt to connect to nic.funet.fi first, then to irc.nada
and finally to garfield.

   *Reciprocal entries:* Each "C" entry requires a corresponding "N"
entry that specifies connection priviliges to other hosts.  The "N"
entry contains the password, if any, that you require other hosts to
have before they can connect to you.  These entries are of the same
format as the "C" entries.

`Format'
     The format for the NOCONNECT entry in the "ircd.conf" is:
     N:<TARGET Host Addr>:<Password>:<TARGET Host NAME>:<Domain
     Mask>:<Class>

     Let us assume that "garfield.mit.edu" connects to your server and
     you want to place password authorization authorization on
     garfield. The "N" entry would be:

     N:garfield.mit.edu:golden:garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a connection from host "garfield.mit.edu",
     and expect a login password of "golden", and expect the host to
     identify itself as "garfield.mit.edu".

     N:18.72.0.252::garfield.mit.edu::

     This line says: expect a Connection from host "18.72.0.252", and
     don't expect login password.  The connecting host should identify
     itself as "garfield.mit.edu".

`N'
     "N" corresponds to a server Noconnect option.

`TARGET Host Addr'
     Specifies the host name or IP address of the machine to connect
     to.  If "user@" prefixes the actual hostname or IP address the
     server will require that the remote username returned by the ident
     server be the same as the one given before the "@".

`Password'
     The password of the other host.  A password must always be present
     for the line to be recognized. If CRYPT_LINK_PASSWORD is defined
     in config.h, this password must be crypted.

`TARGET Host NAME'
     The full hostname of the target machine. This is the name that the
     TARGET server will identify itself with when you connect to it.
     If you were connecting to nic.funet.fi you would receive
     "nic.funet.fi" and that is what you should place in this field.

`Domain Mask'
     Domain masking, see below.

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class.

`Wildcards domains'
     To reduce the great amount of servers in IRCnet wildcard DOMAINS
     were introduced in 2.6. To explain the usage of wildcard domains
     we take an example of such:

     *.de  - a domain name matching all machines in Germany.

     Wildcard domains are useful in that ALL SERVERS in Germany (or any
     other domain area) can be shown as one to the rest of the world.
     Imagine 100 servers in Germany, it would be incredible waste of
     network bandwidth to broadcast all of them to all servers around
     the world.

     So wildcard domains are a great help, but how to use them ?

     They can be defined in the N-line for a given connection, in place
     of "Domain Mask" you write a magic number called wildcard count.

     Wildcard count tells you HOW MANY PARTS of your server's name
     should be replaced by a wildcard. For example, your server's name
     is "tolsun.oulu.fi" and you want to represent it as "*.oulu.fi" to
     "nic.funet.fi". In this case the wildcard count is 1, because only
     one word (tolsun) is replaced by a wildcard.

     If the wildcard count would be 2, then the wildcard domain would
     be "*.fi". Note that with wildcard name "*.fi" you could NOT
     connect to "nic.funet.fi" because that would result in a server
     name *collision* (*.fi matches nic.funet.fi).

     I advise you to not to use wildcard servers before you know for
     sure how they are used, they are mostly beneficial for backbones
     of countries and other large areas with common domain.



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Deny auto-connections,  Next: Hub connections,  Prev: Server connections,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.10 Deny auto-connections
==========================

`Introduction'
     D lines were implemented to give server administrators more
     control on how auto connections are done.  This will most likely
     only be useful for big networks which have complex configurations.

`Format'
     D:<Denied Server Mask>:Denied Class:<Server Name>:Server Class:

`Denied Server Mask'
     This field is matched against all servers currently present on the
     network. If it starts with "!", it reverses the meaning of search.

`Denied Class'
     If this field contains a class number, it will match if any server
     in that class is currently present on the network.  Note that this
     can be true for any server, even the ones not directly connected.

`Server Name'
     This field is matched against the server name that the server
     wants to auto connect to.

`Server Class'
     This field is used to match against the class to which belong the
     servers for which an autoconnect is set.

`Examples'
     D:*.edu::*.fi::

     Don't auto-connect to any "*.fi" server if any server present on
     the network matches "*.edu".

     D:!*.edu::*.fi::

     Don't auto-connect to any "*.fi" server if none of the servers
     present on the network matches "*.edu".

     D::2:eff.org:3:

     Do not auto-connect to "eff.org", or any server in class "3" if a
     server defined to be in class "2" is currently present on the
     network.



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Hub connections,  Next: Leaf connections,  Prev: Deny auto-connections,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.11 Hub connections
====================

`Introduction'
     In direct contrast to L-lines, the server also implements H-lines
     to determine which servers may act as a hub and what they may "hub
     for".  If a server is only going to supply its own name (ie act as
     a solitary leaf) then no H-line is required for, else a H-line
     must be added.

`Format'
     H:<Server Mask>:<SID Mask>:<Server Name>::

`Server Mask'
     All servers that are allowed via this H-line must match the mask
     given in this field.

`SID Mask'
     SIDs of all servers that are allowed via this H-line must match
     the mask given in this field. Empty field is equal to '*', that is
     any SID is allowed to be introduced.

`Server Name'
     This field is used to match exactly against a server name,
     wildcards being treated as literal characters.

`Examples'
     H:*.edu::*.bu.edu::

     Allows a server named "*.bu.edu" to introduce only servers that
     match the "*.edu" name mask, no matter what SID they have.

     H:*:616*:eff.org::

     Allows "eff.org" to introduce (and act as a hub for) any server
     which SID begins with "616".

`Note'
     It is possible to have and use multiple H-lines (or L-lines) for
     the one server.  eg:

     H:*.edu:*:*.bu.edu:: H:*.au:*:*.bu.edu::

     is allowed as is

     L:*.edu:*:*.au:: L:*.com:*:*.au::



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Leaf connections,  Next: Version limitations,  Prev: Hub connections,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.12 Leaf connections
=====================

`Introduction'
     To stop servers which should only act as leaves from hubs becoming
     hubs accidently, the L line was introduced so that hubs can be
     aware of which servers should and shouldnt be treated as leaves. A
     leaf server is supposed to remain a node for the entirity of its
     life whilst connected to the IRC server network.  It is quite easy,
     however for a leaf server to be incorrectly setup and create
     problems by becoming a node of 2 or more servers, ending its life
     as a leaf. The L line enables the administrator of an IRC "Hub
     server" to "stop" a server which is meant to act as a leaf trying
     to make itself a hub.  If, for example, the leaf server connects
     to another server which doesnt have an L-line for it, the one
     which does will drop the connection, once again making the server
     a leaf.

`Format'
     L:<Server Mask>:*:<Server Name>:<Max Depth>:

`Server Mask'
     Mask of which servers the leaf-like attributes are used on when
     the server receives SERVER messages.  The wildcards * and ? may be
     used within this field for matching purposes.  If this field is
     empty, it acts the same as if it were a single * (ie matches
     everything).

`Server Name'
     The name of the server connected to you that for which you want to
     enforce leaf-like attributes upon.

`Max Depth'
     Maximum depth allowed on that leaf and if not specified, a value
     of 1 is assumed.  The depth is checked each time a SERVER message
     is received by the server, the hops to the server being the field
     checked against this max depth and if greater, the connection to
     the server that made its leaf too deep has its connection dropped.
     For the L-line to come into effect, both fields, 2 and 4, must
     match up with the new server being introduced and the server which
     is responsible for introducing this new server.



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Version limitations,  Next: Excluded machines,  Prev: Leaf connections,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.13 Version limitations
========================

`Introduction'
     V-lines are used to restrict server connecting to you based on
     their version and on compile time options.

`Format'
     V:<Version Mask>:<Flags>:<Server Mask>::

`Version Mask'
     The matching version number strings will be rejected.

`Flags'
     If any flag specified in this field is found in the peer's flags
     string, it will be rejected.

`Server Mask'
     This field is used to match server names.  The V line will be used
     for servers matching the mask given in this field.

`Server Type'
     Both the *Version Mask* and the *Flags* should be prefixed with
     the server type identification.  This implementation uses the id
     "*IRC*" (starting with version 2.10).

`Examples'
     V:IRC/021001*::*::

     Disallows any "IRC" server which version is 2.10.1* to connect.

     V:IRC/021001*:IRC/D:*::

     Disallows any "IRC" server which version is 2.10.1* or which has
     been compiled with DEBUGMODE defined to connect.

     V:*/0209*::::

     Disallows any server using the 2.9 protocol to connect.

`Note'
     It is possible to have and use multiple V-lines for the one server
     mask.

     V:IRC/021001*::*::

     V:IRC/021002*::*::

     is allowed.

`Protocol Version'
     Only the 4 first digit of the *Version Number* are standard: they
     define the protocol version.  The remaining of the string is
     implementation dependant; matches on this part should be used with
     particular identification.

`Flags'
     are not standard.  Therefore, this field *should always* contain a
     specific identification.



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Excluded machines,  Next: Service connections,  Prev: Version limitations,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.14 Excluded machines
======================

Disallowing SERVERS in your irc net.

`Introduction'
     In some cases people run into difficulties in net administration.
     For one reason or another you do not want a certain server to be
     in your net (for example because of the security holes it opens for
     every server if it's not secured carefully). In that case you
     should use Q-lines in your server. When you specify a server name
     in Q-line, everytime some server link tries to introduce you a
     server (remember, all server names are broadcast around the net),
     that name is checked if it matches the Q-lines in your server. If
     it matches, then *your server* disconnects the link. Note that just
     placing Q-lines to your server probably results in *your server*
     being left alone, unless other servers have agreed to have the
     same Q-line in their ircd configuration files as well.

`Example'
     Q::of the security holes:foo.bar.baz::

     This command excludes a server named "foo.bar.baz", the reason is
     given to be security holes (you should give a reason, it is
     polite). The first field is unused, so leave it empty.



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Service connections,  Next: Bounce server,  Prev: Excluded machines,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.15 Service connections
========================

`Introduction'
     The Service is a special kind of IRC client. It does not have the
     full abilities of a normal user but can behave in a more active
     manner than a normal client.

     Services are not intended for interactive usage, and are better
     suited for automated clients.

`Format'
     S:<TARGET Host Mask>:<Password>:<Service Name>:<Service
     Type>:<Class>

`TARGET Host Mask'
     The host mask should be set to match the host(s) from which the
     service will be connecting from. This may be either an IP# or full
     name (prefered).

`Password'
     This is the password which must be passed in the SERVICE command.

`Service Name'
     The name used by the service. Services don't have nicknames, but a
     static name defined by the S line.

`Service Type'
     The type of service. It defines the priviledges given to the
     service. Be very careful in the types you allow.  The types can be
     found in include/service.h

`Class'
     The class field should refer to an existing class.

`Notes'
     A service is not a very useful sort of client, it cannot join
     channels or issue certain commands although most are available to
     it. Services are rejected upon sending an unknown or unallowed
     command. Services however, are not affected by flood control and
     can be granted special privileges. It is therefore *wise to
     oversee the use of S-lines with much care.*



File: INSTALL.info,  Node: Bounce server,  Prev: Service connections,  Up: The ircd-conf file

4.16 Bounce server
==================

`Introduction'
     This provides you a way to bounce clients to another server.  This
     information is provided to clients which are denied connection,
     either because their connection class is full, or the server is
     full, or they are not authorized to connect.

`Format'
     B:<Class|Host Mask>::<Server Name>:<Port>:

`B'
     This specifies a Bounce record.

`Class|Host Mask'
     This field specifies to which client this configuration line
     applies to.  It can be either a connection class number, a host
     mask to be matched against the client's hostname, or an IP
     address/mask/bitmask to be matched against the client's IP address.

     When the server is completely full, it rejects clients with the
     "All connections in use" message.  In this case, the server
     doesn't process the connections at all, and has no knowledge of
     the client's host name, or class number.  For these cases, this
     field must be empty.

`Note'
     Class number "-1" is used for rejecting clients that use wrong
     (server-only) port.

`Server Name'
     This specifies the IRC server hostname that the client should use.

`Port'
     This specifies the IRC server port that the client should connect
     to.

`Example'
     B:2::irc.stealth.net:6660:

     Rejected clients in class 2 are advised to use "irc.stealth.net"
     on port 6660.

     B:*.fi::irc.funet.fi:6667:

     Finnish client should use irc.funet.fi when they cannot be taken
     anymore.

     B:::irc2.stealth.net:6667:

     When the server is completely full, clients should use the
     secondary server.

     B:-1::our.server.example:6667:

     Clients that connected to server-only port should really use port
     6667.
