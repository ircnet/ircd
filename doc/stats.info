1 Introduction
**************

So far STATS has one-char parameter. The result always ends with 219
numeric ,,End of STATS report". Whether it was empty output or invalid
parameter can be determined by the char in 219 numeric (after the
nickname): if it is the char we passed as parameter, the output was
empty, if it was asterisk ,,*", there was no such STATS we requested.

   Note: 2.11.2 allows multi-char parameters (there's one such so far).

2 STATS unleashed
*****************

All examples are raw ircd output minus prefix (server name), numeric
(varies from stats to stats) and nickname of a client requesting STATS.
Also ending 219 numeric is omitted in whole.

`a, A - iauth configuration'
          * rfc931
          * socks reject,megaparanoid,cache=0

     Shows all succesfully loaded iauth modules and their options.

`b, B - bounce lines'
          B -1 <NULL> irc.example.org 4444 0
          B <NULL> <NULL> irc.example.net 4444 0

     2nd field is class number or the hostname/IP mask to match the
     client; if NULL, it matches any class or hostname, if "-1", it is
     used only for those clients that were rejected for connecting to
     server-only port.  4th is server name and 5th the port, both
     telling the client where it should connect to.

`c - connect, zipped connect and noconnect lines'
          C *@192.168.0.13 * *.example.net 6667 10

     "C" or "c" (lowercase is a mark for zipped links) are connect
     lines, that is the list of servers we will connect to. 2nd field
     is remote server IP (or name), 3rd the password for connection
     (disguised as "*"), 4th IRC name of a server, 5th - port that
     autoconnection will be attempted to (non-positive disables A/C)
     and finally the class this server will be using is in 6th field.

          N *@192.168.0.13 * *.example.net 1 10

     "N" stands for no-connect lines, and these are the servers that
     will connect to us. It is required that each "C" has its
     corresponding "N".  The format is the same as "C" with an
     exception of last but one field: it is not a port, but a number of
     labels (parts of hostname between dots) from start to replace with
     "*" when introducing us to this server (allows masking).

`d, D - defines'
          HUB:yes MS:3
          LQ:128 MXC:100 TS:60 HRD:30 HGL:900 WWD:15 ATO:90

          complete if stuck

        * ATO (ACCEPTTIMEOUT): seconds to wait for all auth/dns to
          complete (after that client quits with a "Ping timeout"
          reason)

        * KCTL (KILLCHASETIMELIMIT): seconds within which KILL, KICK or
          MODE reaches target after it changed nick

`d5 - defines and 005'
     Sends the same as stats d and also 005 (the same that is sent
     during client registration).

`f, F - file descriptors report'
          1 0.0.0.0 4444 192.168.1.13 51397 Beeth chopin 3774

     For security reasons it is available to operators only. The
     meaning of fields is: file descriptor number, local ip, local
     port, client ip, client port, client nick, client auth (ident),
     idle.

`h, H - hub, leaf, deny lines'
          H * 616* hub.example.org 0 :-1

     Hub line define what servers (2nd field) and what SIDs (3rd field)
     are allowed to be introduced by the server specified in 4th field.

          L * * leaf.example.org 0 :-1

     Leaf line ensures that servers we are connected to (matching 4th
     field) do not become hubs introducing us servers matching the mask
     (2nd field). 3th field is ignored, 5th field is max depth.

          D *.org <NULL> <NULL> 99 :0

     Deny autoconnect to servers that names match 4th field or that are
     in a class specified by 5th field if any of the servers matching
     2nd field or defined to be in class specified in 3rd field are
     currently present on the network or, if 2nd field prefixed with
     "!", denies autoconnect if none of the servers matching 2nd field
     is present on the network.

`i, I - allowed user connections'
          I 127.0.0.1 <NULL> <NULL> 0 10 -

     2nd field is an IP address, IP mask or CIDR, 3rd is password
     (disguised by "*" if present), 4th is a hostname required to
     match, 5th is a port this line is valid for, 6th is the class
     client will be put in and finally 7th field is I-line flags (all
     explained in the INSTALL file). 2nd and 4th fields can be prefixed
     by "user@", which means ident must match as well.

`K - disallowed user connections (aka kill lines)'
          K pc*.example.org sorry,no,entrance * 0 -1

     The hostname or IP to match (CIDR allowed), kill line comment or
     (very rarely used) time interval when kill line is effective,
     username or auth to match, port on which kill line is effective.
     Lowercase "k" matches on auth, read the INSTALL file for more info.

`k - disallowed user connections (aka temporary kill lines)'
          K pc*.example.org sorry,no,entrance * 1200 -1

     The same as for "stats K" with one exception: field last but one
     shows time to live of a temporary kill line (and it always matches
     on all ports).

`l, L - link info'
          clientname[username@host.name] 0 181 11431 37 318 :6442

     1st field is client info (client can be server, too). If uppercase
     "L" is used, then the real IP is shown, not the hostname.  2nd
     field is sendQ, 3rd received lines, 4th received bytes, 5th sent
     lines, 6th sent bytes, 7th is client uptime.

     This command accepts second parameter: if present, it shows the
     above info only for the specified client.

`m, M - commands usage stats'
          COMMANDNAME 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0

     1st field is command name, the rest is in groups of 4 digits:
     total count, total argument bytes, remote count, remote bytes;
     each of 5 groups shows usage within given handler (function
     responsible for dealing with command coming from a given type of
     client), in the following sequence: server, client, oper, service,
     unregistered.

`o, O - operator lines'
          o *@*.example.org * Beeth 0 10

     1st field is operator type, lowercase is local operator, uppercase
     is global.  2nd field is the user@hostname required to match, 3rd
     is password (disguised as "*"), 4th is the nickname, 5th is port
     (though unused) and 6th is the class user will get after becoming
     operator.

`p - ping reports'
          irc.example.org[*@192.168.1.13] 11 0 0 -1

     1st is servername (and its socketname), 2nd is sequence number of
     last udp ping sent, 3rd is number of received answers, 4th is
     average response time in miliseconds, 5th is preference used in
     autoconnecting. Only last 20 minutes are remembered.

`P - ports listening'
          4444 * - 0 246 14989 48 427 7169 1 active

     1st field is port number, 2nd is IP we listen on (or unix socket
     directory), 3rd is P-line flags, 4th field is sendQ, 5th received
     lines, 6th received bytes, 7th sent lines, 8th sent bytes, 9th is
     client uptime, 10th is number of clients using that P-line and
     finally, 11th shows whether it is "active" or "inactive" (delayed
     accept).

`q, Q - quarantine lines'
          Q <NULL> security_reasons irc.example.com 0 -1

     3rd field is a reason for quarantining server matching 4th field.

     Apart from iauth stats (start time, number of times respawned,
     options), all iauth modules statistics (if available).

     Most of these are self-explanatory. Should you want more words
     about some, drop me a note.

`u, U - uptime'
          Server Up 0 days, 0:31:55

     You guessed right, that's ircd uptime.

     2nd field is version to match, 3rd is server flags, 4th is server
     name mask.  (If all match, server is rejected; this one rejects
     all 2.10 servers compiled with 'D' (debugmode).)

`X - denied connections'
          X * . . * * *

     Denies client connection based on what client sends in USER
     command. First four fields of X line correspond one by one to
     those of USER, then nick. Last field is matched against client ip
     or host mask (defaults to any if not present).
