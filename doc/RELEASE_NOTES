This is version 2.11.0 of the IRC software.
===============================================================================
Important changes in 2.11.0 (since 2.10.3p5):

	* New server-server protocol based on Unique IDs. In pure 2.11 collided
	  clients will stay on with changed nick.
	* M: requires SID now. Please read INSTALL.txt and example.conf
	* A: accepts "network name" parameter.
	* H: can have SID masks to accept. Read docs.
	* Nicknames of local clients cannot have [\]{|} chars. Sorry.
	* Channelnames created on 2.11.0 will have chars {}~\ in their name
	  automatically converted to []^|. Sorry.
	* I: require now both name AND addr to match. Revise your config.
	* I: have flags now ('F', 'R', 'I', 'E', 'N', 'D', 'M'), check INSTALL
	  file for details.
	* OPER_REMOTE is removed (and server behaves like it was defined).
	* stats l/L no longer returns listeners, use stats P.
	* DNS command is oper only from now.
	* DELAY_CLOSE is default, this may use some extra fds.
	* resolving slightly changed: when host has CNAMEs, use the name that
	  client IP PTR points to, not the CNAME that points to client IP.
	* resolv.conf can have IPv6 nameservers (this makes ircd fully IPv6).
	* P: can have flags ('D' and 'S'), check INSTALL file for details.
	* class usage was moved from end of trace to stats Y.
	* redundant bans are allowed to be set now.
	* SERVICE command has been changed slightly (removed 2nd (stok) and 5th
	  (hopcount) parameters), please update your services.
	* localstatedir in configure changed from var/run to var, be careful.
	* user mode +w is doing nothing: class usage is in stats Y and wallops
	  are sent to a new server channel &WALLOPS.
	* irc client is no longer included.
	* rehash q was changed to rehash d (dns flush).
	* ircd is capable of including files to config file without need of m4.
	* new commands: TKLINE and UNTKLINE.
	* stats K returns list of klines, stats k list of tklines.
	* rehash t removes all tklines.
	* O: have flags now, check INSTALL file for details; WARNING: no flags
	  means no privileges at all!

This is version 2.10.3 of the IRC software.
===============================================================================

Important changes in 2.10.3p4 (since 2.10.3p2):
       * ip6.arpa is now default, with defining SIXBONE_HACK we
         also recognize ip6.int
       * RESTRICT_HOSTNAMES is default on, allowing client hosts in
         conformance with RFC 1034, 1035, and 1123 (no '&', '*', '\' or
         other "strange" characters)
       * CLONE_CHECK default on, not SLOW_ACCEPT
       * find_kill() is aware of '+' prefix, so no need to add another
         K:line for it (or using *username)

===============================================================================

Important changes in 2.10.3p2 (since 2.10.3):
	* u@h limits in Y:lines now default to 1.1, not 0.0
	* WHO ** is not special anymore (may break clients depending on it)
	* CIDR support in O:lines
	* no need to use :ffff: mapped IPv4 addresses anymore
	* now ircd reopens logfiles only upon HUP; this means it is not enough
	  to remove (or rename) logfile to stop logging (but we gain a lot!)

===============================================================================

New features in 2.10.3:
	* new options for iauth.conf to better control iauth behaviour
	* iauth now supports dynamically shared modules.
	* socks module now checks for both v4 and v5 of the SOCKS protocol.
	* iauth has a new module: LHEx, see ftp://ftp.irc.org/irc/server/LHEx

Important changes in 2.10.3 (since 2.10.2):
	* default PATHs have changed, see INSTALL file and Makefile.
	* V line code was fixed, and format slightly changed again.

------

Because of the many changes concerning iauth, it is recommended that this new
version of the iauth program not be used with older version of the IRC daemon.

===============================================================================

Version 2.10.2 of the software adds support for IPv6.

Important changes in 2.10.2 (since 2.10.1):
	* iauth's socks module now uses an internal cache.
	* iauth's socks module now checks for SOCKSv4 (rather than v5) proxies.

===============================================================================

2.10 uses a new (server-server) protocol.

New features in 2.10.0:

	* slave process handles authentication (ident lookups, ..).
	* creation of a collision proof type of channels (prefix !).
	* opless !channels may be reoped by the server (mode +r).
	* added channel mode +e (EFnet's exceptions to bans).
	* added channel mode +I (invitations).
	* /invite can now be used to override channel bans & limit.
	* away status is propagated again. (away messages are not).
	* users need +o (or +v) to speak on a channel where they're banned.

Important configuration changes between 2.9.x and 2.10.x:

	* The V line format has changed!

------

If the irc daemon is unable to bind any socket to listen to for incoming
connections, it will die rather than stay alive.

===============================================================================

New feature in 2.9.5:
	* D lines created.

------

2.9.5 is taking steps to suppress the usage of the 2.9 JOIN
format (:nickname JOIN #channel^Gov).  Future versions will
not generate such joins anymore.  In order to make the
transition smooth, it is imperative that all servers on the
IRC network be upgraded to 2.9.5 when the JOIN syntax is
abandonned.  Not doing so will result in a considerable
increase of the amount of bandwidth used during netjoins.

As a result, MIRC_KLUDGE is now defined by default in config.h

------

2.9.5 can be compiled on a W32 system using the Cygwin32
library (http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/).

===============================================================================

2.9.4 doesn't support 2.8 links anymore.  A 2.8.x server cannot
be directly linked to a 2.9.4 server.  They can however coexist
on the same IRC network.

------

Configuration changes between 2.9.3 and 2.9.4:

	* The format for I lines was extended.
	* The format for B lines has slightly changed.
	* The format for Y lines has changed ([user@]host limits).
	* K lines on IP addresses now match resolving hosts by default.

------

As announced with the 2.9.3 release, the NOTE feature has been removed.
A replacement has been written as an independant package, and can be found
at the following location: ftp://ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de/pub/net/irc/noteserv/

===============================================================================

2.9.3 doesn't support 2.7 protocol anymore.  Don't run 2.9.3
and 2.7 servers on the same IRC network.

------

New features in 2.9.3:

	* compression of server links.
	* virtual IP support.
	* B lines created. (client redirection)
	* k lines created. (OTHER ident)
	* V lines created. (restrict peers' compile time options)
	* new type of client: services.

------

Important configuration changes between 2.9.2 and 2.9.3:

	* M and P lines format has changed since 2.9.2, it is important
	  to update your ircd.conf !
	* kill lines are now case sensitive (K: and k: are different)
